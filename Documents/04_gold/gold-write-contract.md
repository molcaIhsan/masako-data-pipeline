The Gold write contract
Audience: whoever writes the work_unit_* Airflow DAGs and dbt models — currently Wira Hutomo (pwawiwa, wira.hutomo@gmail.com).

Status: normative. Until the DAG is in a repository (see Open risks) this document is the only durable specification of what the Gold tier expects.

Scope: the oee schema in the mes-master-data Postgres database — the tables whose DDL is checked in at apps/api/src/shared/database/migration/0003_oee_gold_schema.sql, as amended by 0006_oee_product_perf_wu_hour.sql, which adds product_perf_wu_hour and drops work_unit_perf_analytics (still seven — see §9), and by 0008_oee_reject_count_wu_shift.sql, which adds reject_count_wu_shift and takes the count to eight. See §10 for what that migration expects of you, and §3.8 for the columns it asks you to populate. Amended again by 0009_oee_downtime_log_events.sql, which adds downtime_log_events and takes the count to nine; see §11 and §3.9.

0010_oee_shift_report_approvals.sql adds two more tables — work_unit_shift_report_approvals and work_unit_shift_report_approval_events — but they are not part of the nine and nothing is asked of you for them. They are written exclusively by mes-oee-monitor, and the pipeline must never read, write or model them. See §12, which is a page of what NOT to do.

Amended 2026-08-25 again by 0011_oee_downtime_reason_shape.sql, which adds three CHECK constraints to downtime_reports and asks nothing of you — but changes what a malformed label does from "a slightly wrong chart" to "an aborted statement". See §14.

Amended 2026-08-25, and this one DOES ask something of you. The downtime-edit write path has shipped, so oee.downtime_report_history now receives rows. That changes how you must build downtime_reports: re-deriving its four operator-mutable columns from Silver on every run silently discards operator corrections. §13 is the change, and it is the only section here that asks you to revise a model you have already written. No migration accompanies it — every column and table involved already exists.

1. Who writes what
Tier	Store	Written by	State
Bronze	TimescaleDB	Telegraf	exists
Silver (hot)	TimescaleDB	Apache Flink	R&D
Gold (cold)	Postgres oee schema	Apache Airflow → dbt, direct DB write	not built
Gold — operator mutations	Postgres oee schema	mes-oee-monitor (this repo)	not built
Two rules follow, and everything else in this document is a consequence of them:

Airflow/dbt owns every bulk write. It INSERTs and upserts rows. It writes Gold directly, not through this service's HTTP API.

This repo writes only named operator mutations. Approving a shift report (open → closed), and editing a downtime — changing its category, updating its reasons, adding or removing actions. Against the twelve tables above it never inserts and never deletes — its only write to them is an UPDATE on a downtime's own columns.

That sentence used to end at "never inserts and never deletes", full stop. 0010 makes the qualifier necessary: this service now owns three tables outright — work_unit_shift_report_approvals, work_unit_shift_report_approval_events and oee.downtime_report_history — and inserts into all three. They hold no pipeline data, they are keyed on the natural key of a shift report or on a stop's source_event_id rather than on any serial, and the pipeline has no reason to write them.

Both mutations are now built (2026-08-25), and the second one has a consequence for you. oee.downtime_report_history was empty when this was written; it is not any more, and §13 is what your model must do about it. The UPDATE on a downtime's own columns is still the ONLY write this service makes to any of the nine — what changed is that the pipeline must now READ one of the three above when rebuilding one of the nine.

Approving a report also freezes its downtime: the edit endpoint refuses a stop belonging to a closed report. That is a decision about this service's own behaviour and asks nothing of you, but it is why a reopen endpoint exists beside it.

The near-realtime /dashboard reads Silver, not Gold. Gold is cold: it serves reports.

mes-oee-monitor owns the DDL for all nine tables. Schema changes belong in a numbered migration in that directory, not in oee_db_setup_dag.py or a dbt on-run-start hook. If the pipeline needs a column, ask for it here and it ships as a migration.

One table is outside rule 2 entirely. downtime_log_events, added by 0009, is the one table this service will never write at all — not even as an operator mutation. Editing a downtime writes downtime_reports; the log is the record of what was observed, and a bar that moves when an operator corrects a stop is not a count of anything. Its row-level audit trigger exists to notice if that ever quietly changes. See §3.9.

2. Per-table grain and upsert key
Table	Grain	Upsert key (enforced)
work_unit_shift_reports	work unit × shift × day	wu_shift_report_key (date, shift, work_unit_id)
work_unit_day_reports	work unit × day	wu_day_report_key (date, work_unit_id)
work_unit_month_reports	work unit × month	wu_month_report_key (date, month, work_unit_id)
product_count_wu_shift	work unit × shift day × shift × product	pk_product_count_wu_shift (work_unit_id, shift_date, shift, product_id)
product_count_wu_day	work unit × day × product	pk_product_count_wu_day (work_unit_id, date, product_id)
downtime_reports	one machine stop	none — see below
product_perf_wu_hour	work unit × local hour × product	pk_product_perf_wu_hour (work_unit_id, bucket_start, product_id)
reject_count_wu_shift	work unit × shift day × shift × product × reason	pk_reject_count_wu_shift (work_unit_id, shift_date, shift, product_id, reason)
downtime_log_events	one machine stop, as logged (immutable)	pk_downtime_log_events (event_id)
work_center_shift_reports	work centre × shift × business day	wc_shift_report_key (business_date, shift, work_center_id)
work_center_day_reports	work centre × business day	wc_day_report_key (business_date, work_center_id)
work_center_month_reports	work centre × month	wc_month_report_key (business_date, work_center_id)
Three tables are deliberately absent from that list, because you must not write them at all: downtime_report_history (0007), work_unit_shift_report_approvals and work_unit_shift_report_approval_events (0010). They are mes-oee-monitor's, end to end. Their enforcement is mechanical rather than editorial — see §12.

Use these as the ON CONFLICT target (dbt: unique_key). They exist precisely so a re-run overwrites rather than duplicates.

2.1 The idempotency gap — read this before the first backfill
downtime_reports has no natural key. Its only unique index is on the surrogate id (serial), which the pipeline does not supply and cannot match on. There is no ON CONFLICT target, so dbt cannot upsert it — a DAG retry, a DLQ replay, or a backfill will silently insert every row a second time.

This gap used to name two tables. work_unit_perf_analytics was the other, and 0006 dropped it; its replacement product_perf_wu_hour is born with a natural key, so it does not join this list. It upserts, the DELETE-then-INSERT requirement below never applies to it, and a re-run restates rather than duplicates. downtime_reports is now the only table with this problem.

reject_count_wu_shift, added by 0008, is born with a key for the same reason and by the same deliberate choice — the five-column primary key in §2 above. It upserts, so nothing in this section applies to it either. That is also why its reason column carries a constraint the other tables' labels do not: it is a key member, so a renamed counter is a new row rather than a corrected one. See §3.8.

downtime_log_events, added by 0009, is born with a key too — and it is precisely the key this section has been asking for. The Preferred fix below is "a deterministic identifier from the Silver event … make it UNIQUE"; on that table the same identifier is the whole primary key, because a table carrying no timestamps has no composite candidate at all. So it upserts, and nothing in this section applies to it either.

Write the same string into both. If downtime_log_events.event_id and downtime_reports.source_event_id (§3.3.2) carry one identifier, the two tables become reconcilable — which is what makes §3.9's second test able to say anything precise — and this section closes on both tables at once. That is one field.

This is not hypothetical: poc-flink-v2 already ships backfill_bronze_silver.py and dlq_monitor_dag.py. Duplicated stops do not error; they render as a doubled timeline strip and inflated downtime totals, which nobody would spot from the screen.

Requested fix — pick one, and tell us which so the migration matches:

Preferred: carry a deterministic identifier from the Silver event through to Gold — a source_event_id text that Flink already assigns per detected stop — and make it UNIQUE. This survives changes to start/end times when a stop is corrected upstream.
Fallback: UNIQUE (work_unit_id, start_at) on downtime_reports. Cheaper, but it breaks if a stop's start_at is ever revised, since the revision looks like a new row.
Until one lands, the DAG writing downtime_reports must be DELETE-then-INSERT scoped to the run's window, never append-only. Say so explicitly in the model config.

AMENDED 2026-08-25 — this is now a blocker on a SHIPPED feature, not only on your idempotency. The downtime-edit endpoint addresses a stop by source_event_id and oee.downtime_report_history keys on it NOT NULL, so a stop without one cannot be edited at all — the row menu disables its Edit item and says why, rather than offering an action that would 404. On the dev database a few rows carry a hand-seeded UUID (three of seventeen at the time of writing) and those are editable; everything the pipeline has loaded is not. Populating the column is what turns the feature on for real.

And note what happens in the same run that populates it: the override join in §13 stops being inert at exactly that moment. Land the two together.

3. Schema requirements for v1
These are already filed as TODOs against this repo. Because the DAG is greenfield, each is a line in a model rather than a migration plus a backfill against a live table — so they are far cheaper now than later. § numbers refer to TODOS.md.

3.1 business_date — write the business day as a real date (§17)
work_unit_shift_reports.date is a timestamptz holding the shift's start instant, not a calendar day. Every consumer that wants a day out of it has to resolve the plant's time zone first, and one of them cannot: the month filter spans many work units in a single query and the zone is not a column, so no single predicate is correct. Measured against the live database:

plant             shift 3 of Aug 31   ->  instant          in the August filter?   truth
Asia/Jakarta        23:00+07          ->  Aug 31 16:00Z           yes               yes   ok
America/Chicago     23:00-05          ->  Sep  1 04:00Z           no                yes   WRONG
America/Chicago     shift 3 of Jul 31 ->  Aug  1 04:00Z           yes               no    WRONG
Please write a business_date date column on every table that has a business day, alongside the existing date. It also makes the watermark post-hook in §4 uniform, and lets the SKU join drop its AT TIME ZONE conversion.

Partly delivered by 0013 (2026-08-27). The column now EXISTS, nullable, on work_unit_shift_reports, work_unit_day_reports and work_unit_month_reports, alongside a time_zone text. The schema half is done; the writing and the backfill are yours. §15.3 defines exactly what the value must be, including the 07:00 → 07:00 day boundary.

This has already caused one shipped bug: the product-count join originally compared p.shift_date = r.date — a date against a timestamptz — which Postgres resolves by widening the date to midnight, so only a shift starting at exactly 00:00 in the session zone could match. At UTC+7 that is shift 1 alone; shifts 2 and 3 silently returned nothing and the card rendered "No product output recorded for this shift", indistinguishable from an idle machine.

3.2 area_id and factory_id on downtime_reports (§9)
area_id and area_name now EXIST — migration 0007 added them, because the downtime detail drawer names the full area / line / machine hierarchy. They are empty. Nothing writes them, so this section is now a request to POPULATE two columns rather than to add them, and factory_id is still outstanding.

SCOPE_COLUMN in downtime-handler.ts is deliberately NOT extended in the meantime: an all-NULL column would turn scope=area from an honest 400 into a 200 with an empty result, which is worse. It widens the day the pipeline writes the column, and not before.

GET /api/v1/downtimes/timeline accepts scope=area and scope=factory but answers 400, because the table carries no column to filter on. Serving them today would mean resolving the hierarchy through mes-master-data first and inheriting its failure modes for data that was sitting in Gold the whole time. Two denormalised columns turn all four scopes into one WHERE clause, permanently. work_unit_id and work_center_id are already denormalised this way.

3.3 Integrity on downtime_reports (§10)
CHECK (end_at IS NULL OR end_at >= start_at) — inverted rows are currently possible, and this service drops them at runtime (clipToWindow, counted as downtime_rows_dropped_total). Rejecting at the source beats counting.
duration is a nullable int8 written independently of start_at/end_at and can disagree with them. Make it GENERATED ALWAYS AS ... STORED, or drop it and let readers compute it. Note this column is now read by nothing at all — every consumer derives duration from the timestamps, and the reason aggregate below additionally CLIPS it to the shift window, which the stored value could not express even if it agreed.
3.3.1 reason wants to be a column, not a jsonb array
This is now the THIRD consumer of reason ->> 0, and the first that FILTERS on it rather than grouping. GET /api/v1/downtimes/by-reason/detail — the drill-down behind the Pareto's eye button — matches reason ->> 0 = $1 to list the stops behind one bar. A WHERE on an expression over jsonb cannot use an index, so it scans the seven-day slice scopeAndWindow narrows to. A real primary_reason text column would buy the filter, the GROUP BY and an index in one change; an expression index on ((reason ->> 0)) was considered and rejected, because it would index a shape this section asks you to delete.

The equality is also now load-bearing in a way grouping alone was not: the drill-down and the bar it was opened from MUST select the same rows, or the detail page will not sum to the chart. Both compose one shared SQL fragment for exactly that reason, and an integration test pins it. GET /api/v1/downtimes/by-reason — the Availability Loss and Schedule Loss Paretos, which are the same query over category — groups on the FIRST element of the array and discards the rest, because a stop has one cause for accounting purposes and exploding the array would count one 40-minute stop under two reasons and make the bars sum to more than the shift. The browser already renders the array's other elements in the Downtime Details table, so both readings of the column now ship.

Three consequences worth putting in front of whoever writes the model:

The grouping key is an expression over jsonb. §8 measured the plant-year Pareto at 2799 ms against reason#>>'{0}' and 2111 ms against a plain text column — ~25%, for a column that is a single string in every row we have seen.
Element order is now load-bearing. Nothing today guarantees that reason[0] is the primary cause rather than whichever the operator typed first. If the pipeline can order the array by significance, say so; if it cannot, a dedicated primary_reason text alongside the array is the honest fix and settles the question permanently.
Non-string elements degrade silently. The reader guards with jsonb_typeof(reason -> 0) = 'string' and folds anything else — plus [], [""] and whitespace — into one unlabelled bucket. That is a guard, not a feature: those rows are unattributable downtime, and they render as "Unspecified" on an operator's screen.
A THIRD READING OF THE ARRAY NOW EXISTS, and it strengthens this ask rather than weakening it. The paragraph above says the array's non-first elements are only ever rendered, in the Downtime Details table. That is no longer true: the Losses page's Others tab AGGREGATES over every element, counting how many stops cited each reason. It does so from downtime_log_events.reasons (§3.9) and not from this column — for the mutability reason §3.9 gives, and because that table's array is a text[] rather than jsonb, which is this section's ask applied to a column whose semantics genuinely are a set of strings. So the two requests are consistent: downtime_reports wants one scalar cause it can index and filter, and the event log wants all of them typed. Neither wants a jsonb array.

3.3.2 The six columns migration 0007 added, and what must fill them
0007_oee_downtime_detail.sql added six nullable columns to downtime_reports and one new table. Every one of them is empty and will stay empty until the DAG writes it. They ship ahead of the data deliberately — the alternative was a screen that cannot be built until an unwritten pipeline lands — and the UI renders an em dash for each, which is what the design already shows.

Column	What it feeds on screen	Notes
source_event_id text UNIQUE	the "Downtime ID" on the detail table; the key the history table joins on	Also §2.1's preferred idempotency key. See below — this is the one that matters most.
area_id / area_name	"Area Name" in the detail drawer	§3.2 above
detail_reason text	"Detail Reason" in the drawer — the operator's elaboration on reason	unbounded; rendered for one record at a time
input_by varchar(255)	"Input by"	a name, not a key: there is no users table in this database
maintained_by varchar(255)	"Maintained by"	same
source_event_id is the ask worth reading twice. It is simultaneously the public identifier the UI links on and the ON CONFLICT target §2.1 has been asking for. Those are the same requirement seen from two ends: because the table has no natural key, §2.1 mandates DELETE-then-INSERT scoped to the run window, which means every id changes on every run — so a deep link or a history row keyed on id would silently come to mean a different stop. The UNIQUE index is over a nullable column on purpose: Postgres permits any number of NULLs, so today's rows coexist untouched and the constraint starts biting the moment the pipeline writes the key.

Please carry a deterministic id from the Silver event through to Gold. A value that survives a stop being corrected upstream is what makes both the upsert and the drill-down correct.

oee.downtime_report_history is the per-field change trail behind the Changes History panel. This service writes it — it is an operator mutation, not a pipeline concern — so the DAG must never insert, update or delete there. It has no foreign key to downtime_reports, both because the oee schema has none anywhere and because an FK would block the DELETE-then-INSERT above.

AMENDED 2026-08-25: the write path now exists, so this table is no longer merely "not yours to model" — you have to READ it. See §13: its latest row per field is the authority for the four operator-mutable columns, and rebuilding those from Silver without it discards operator corrections silently.

It is very nearly empty, and the reason has moved from code to DATA: the pipeline does not write source_event_id, so almost nothing can attach to it. The endpoint reports trackedMembers alongside the entries so the UI can distinguish "nothing has been edited" from "none of these stops can be tracked at all" — and for any stop the pipeline loaded, it is the second.

3.4 factor_to_base consistency (§13)
listProductCount multiplies total_out, reject and rework by factor_to_base, so one row with a wrong factor renders a plausible number rather than failing. CHECK (factor_to_base > 0) admits any positive value and nothing downstream can validate it. Guarantee that all rows sharing (product_id, uom_id, base_uom_id) carry the same factor_to_base — ideally by sourcing it from a reference table rather than recomputing per row.

Note good_out is deliberately not scaled: Finish Good stays in its production unit.

3.5 The master rate must arrive in Gold — product_perf_wu_hour.ideal_rate_per_hour
This is the one value the pipeline has to fetch that it does not fetch today. The standard/ideal production rate is owned by mes-master-data; it must be resolved at load time and written onto the row. mes-oee-monitor will never call mes-master-data for it — for the same reason product and UOM names are denormalised today, and the same reason §3.2 asks for area_id/factory_id: a read path that reaches into another service inherits its availability.

Denominate it in uom_id — the same unit as total_out on the same row, not the base unit. Cross-product comparisons apply factor_to_base themselves.
Resolve it as-of the bucket, not as-of the load. Standards change. A backfill of March must use March's standard, or every re-run silently restates history. Write the master record's effective-from date into ideal_rate_valid_from so the choice is auditable.
Write NULL when there is no standard. Do not substitute 0, do not substitute the actual rate, do not drop the row. NULL means "unknown", every downstream aggregation is written to propagate it, and the chart renders it as a gap. 0 makes attainment infinite; the actual rate makes the loss vanish. Set ideal_rate_source to one of master-data / work-unit-default / carried-forward / unknown so a fallback is visible in the data rather than only in a DAG's source. A CHECK enforces that vocabulary.
Restate names, codes, factor_to_base and the rate on every upsert, so a master-data correction heals on the next run instead of leaving March disagreeing with April.
Do not write actual_rate_per_hour or ideal_out. Both are GENERATED ALWAYS ... STORED; Postgres computes them and rejects any attempt to assign to them. That is deliberate — downtime_reports.duration is written independently of start_at/end_at and can disagree with them (§3.3), and this is that bug prevented by construction rather than by a CHECK that rounding would break.

The dbt trap this creates, verified against Postgres 18.4. dbt-postgres builds the DO UPDATE SET list from the target relation's columns, so a naive merge model fails with column "actual_rate_per_hour" can only be updated to DEFAULT. Configure one of:

{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    unique_key=['work_unit_id', 'bucket_start', 'product_id'],
    incremental_strategy='delete+insert'
) }}
delete+insert is the better default here because the delete scopes naturally to the run's business_date window. If you prefer merge, add merge_exclude_columns=['actual_rate_per_hour', 'ideal_out'].

Why the split matters more than it looks. ideal_rate_per_hour is a rate and therefore non-additive, but ideal_out — the same standard weighted by the runtime actually recorded — is additive. That is what lets a day or a month roll up correctly:

   two full hours at 1000/h, then a three-minute sliver at 2000/h

     AVG(actual_rate_per_hour)                      = 1333.3 /h   ← WRONG
     sum(total_out) * 3600000 / sum(runtime)        = 1024.4 /h   ← right
The sliver carries a third of the weight of two full hours, and the error is flattering — the same direction as the two failures §4 exists for. Over a month of hourly rows it compounds.

3.6 How to cut the buckets — the highest-risk instruction in this document
Bucket on the plant's local wall clock:

date_trunc('hour', ts AT TIME ZONE :plant_tz)   -- then convert back to an instant
Never date_trunc('hour', ts) on the UTC value. Shift boundaries are on the local hour (07:00 / 15:00 / 23:00, SHIFT_WINDOWS in apps/api/src/module/downtime/downtime.ts — read them from there, do not restate them), so local-hour buckets nest exactly 8 per shift, 24 per business day, with no bucket straddling a boundary. UTC-hour buckets do not nest for any plant at a non-whole-hour offset:

  Asia/Jakarta   +07:00   local-hour == UTC-hour buckets     ← indistinguishable
  Asia/Kolkata   +05:30   every bucket straddles a boundary by 30 min
  Asia/Kathmandu +05:45   ... by 45 min
At UTC+7 a UTC-bucketing pipeline ships green and stays green. It breaks silently at the first non-whole-hour plant, and every shift total is then wrong at both ends by an amount too small to notice per shift and large enough to matter per month. This is the same correct-for-Jakarta-only failure family as §3.1's America/Chicago table. Test 1 in §3.7 is what catches it mechanically.

Per row also write:

Column	Meaning
time_zone	the IANA zone the buckets were cut in. Makes the rule auditable from the data.
business_date	the SHIFT's business day. Shift 3's post-midnight buckets carry the previous date.
shift	1–3.
hour_of_day	local clock hour 0–23. A label and a GROUP BY key, never a key.
shift_hour_seq	0-based position within the shift: 0–7 normally, 0–8 on a DST fall-back day, 0–6 on a spring-forward day.
Emit no row for a bucket with no runtime and no output. Emit one row per product per bucket — a changeover at 10:20 is two rows in the 10:00 bucket — and let their runtime values sum to at most 3,600,000 ms.

3.7 Three dbt tests, at error severity
Three rules above are not expressible as row-level constraints. They belong in the model's tests, and they are the only thing standing between a silent bucketing defect and a customer finding it.

-- 1. Bucket coverage. Catches UTC bucketing, a lost hour, and a shift attributed
--    to the wrong business day. This is the test that would catch a +05:30 plant.
--    7-9 rather than = 8, because DST makes a shift legitimately 7 or 9 buckets long.
SELECT work_unit_id, business_date, shift, count(DISTINCT bucket_start) AS buckets
  FROM {{ this }} GROUP BY 1,2,3
HAVING count(DISTINCT bucket_start) NOT BETWEEN 7 AND 9

-- 2. No bucket holds more than an hour of runtime across all of its products.
--    The row-level CHECK cannot see across products; this can.
SELECT work_unit_id, bucket_start, sum(runtime) AS ms
  FROM {{ this }} GROUP BY 1,2 HAVING sum(runtime) > 3600000

-- 3. Hourly output reconciles with product_count_wu_shift for the same shift.
--    Two independently computed sources for one number; if they disagree, one of
--    them is being shown to an operator. Also the only thing that catches a
--    time-zone correction that re-buckets production without colliding on the key.
SELECT h.work_unit_id, h.business_date, h.shift, h.product_id
  FROM (SELECT work_unit_id, business_date, shift, product_id, sum(total_out) AS t
          FROM {{ this }} GROUP BY 1,2,3,4) h

 WHERE h.t IS DISTINCT FROM p.total_out
3.8 reject_count_wu_shift — what must fill it (§24, §29)
0008_oee_reject_count_wu_shift.sql adds one new table, and every row of it is missing. Nothing writes it. It ships ahead of the data for the reason 0007 did — the alternative was a screen that cannot be built until an unwritten model lands — and until you write it the Losses page's Quality Loss tab renders "not loaded yet" for every shift.

This is the table TODOS.md §24 predicted. reject and rework are scalars on work_unit_shift_reports, and product_count_wu_shift carries the same two per SKU; neither has a reason dimension, so there has never been anything to rank. The design asks for a bar per reject reason naming the machine, the reason, its weight, the unit the sensor counted in, and the same quantity converted to a comparable unit. Not one of those five is expressible against any existing table.

Grain: work unit × shift day × shift × product × reason. Upsert key in §2. The names the reference design shows — Total_NG_Prod, NG_Over_Count, Reject_Count, NG_Under_Count — look like PLC counter tags rather than master-data reasons, which is why the table carries both identities. See the reason* rows below.

Column	What it feeds on screen	Notes
reason varchar(255)	"Reject Reason", and the Pareto's x axis	A PRIMARY KEY MEMBER — it must be stable. Read the first sub-section below before choosing what goes in it.
reason_code / reason_id	nothing yet; the master-data half of the reason's identity	ms_reject.reject_reasons.code / .id. That table is empty upstream today. Nullable, so not key members.
source_tag / count_point_id	nothing yet; the provenance half	ms_core.count_points.source_tag / .id. Lets a counter be traced to the tag it came from.
uom_code + counter_value	"Counter Unit" — 48 CALENDER	As the sensor counted it. Never scaled. Not comparable across counters.
base_uom_code + factor_to_base	the unit the converted column is denominated in	§3.4's consistency requirement applies unchanged. Converge on one base unit per work unit — see below.
converted_value	the "Converted" column, and the figure the bars are drawn from	GENERATED ALWAYS ... STORED. Do not assign to it. See the dbt trap below.
weight_gram numeric(15,3)	"Weight" — 15232 gr, or an em dash	Write NULL, never 0. This is the ask most likely to be got wrong; read it below.
frequency integer	"Freq."	How many reject records stand behind the row.
reject_time bigint	the Pareto's duration ranking	Nullable and unwritten today, so that one radio ranks a column of zeros. Named on screen rather than hidden.
work_unit_name varchar(255) NOT NULL	"Machine Name"	Unusual in this schema — the report tables allow NULL. The design annotates the column "should not be empty".
shift_date date + time_zone	which shift the rows belong to	shift_date is the SHIFT's business day, matching product_count_wu_shift.shift_date. §3.1 applies here too.
weight_gram: write NULL, never 0 — the one to read twice
The design annotates the Weight column "some reason does not have weight value", and the reference mock renders 0 gr for two of its four counters. Those are two different claims and the screen renders them differently:

  weight_gram = NULL  ->  "—"       the counter has no scale behind it
  weight_gram = 0     ->  "0 gr"    it was weighed, and weighed nothing
Writing 0 for "not weighed" is undetectable downstream and quietly wrong in three places at once: the cell asserts a measurement nobody took, the weight ranking treats an unmeasured counter as a measured empty one, and — because sum() over an all-NULL set is NULL while sum() over zeros is 0 — the shift's weight total flips from "nothing was weighed" to "the shift weighed nothing". The reader depends on that sum() behaviour rather than special-casing it, which is exactly why the column is nullable.

converted_value is GENERATED — and the dbt trap §3.5 already documented
converted_value numeric(15,3)
  GENERATED ALWAYS AS (round(counter_value * factor_to_base, 3)) STORED
Postgres computes it and rejects any attempt to assign to it. That is deliberate, and it is §3.3's lesson applied before it can bite: downtime_reports.duration is written independently of start_at/end_at and can disagree with them, and this is the same defect prevented by construction in the one column the chart plots.

The consequence is the trap §3.5 records for product_perf_wu_hour, and it applies here verbatim — a naive merge fails with column "converted_value" can only be updated to DEFAULT:

{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    unique_key=['work_unit_id', 'shift_date', 'shift', 'product_id', 'reason'],
    incremental_strategy='delete+insert'
) }}
delete+insert is the better default for the same reason it is there: the delete scopes naturally to the run's shift_date window. If you prefer merge, add merge_exclude_columns=['converted_value'].

reason is a key member, so it must be stable
reason is the last column of the primary key, because the table has no other candidate — both halves of the reason's identity (reason_code/reason_id and source_tag/count_point_id) are nullable, and a nullable column cannot key anything.

So a renamed counter is a new row, not a corrected one. A tag that changes from NG_Over_Count to NG_OverCount between runs splits one shift's history into two bars that each look plausible. Write the canonical tag the plant and the machine's HMI use, and if that vocabulary is ever renamed upstream, say so — it is a data migration, not a model change.

The UI renders this value verbatim, deliberately: prettifying Total_NG_Prod into "Total NG Prod" would break the one string an operator can match against the machine in front of them.

Mixed base units make the converted column useless — please avoid them
The converted column exists so counters in different sensor units can be compared. That works only while they convert to the same base unit. If one work unit's counters carry base_uom_code = 'BAG' and another's 'CARTON' within one shift, there is no sum that means anything, and the reader is written to say so rather than to add them:

per bucket, counter_unit and converted_unit come back NULL and the cell renders an em dash;
per shift, convertedUnit comes back NULL and the card states that quantities are not comparable and shows no total.
That is honest and it is also useless to the person reading it. Please converge on one base unit per work unit where the plant allows it. This is §3.4's consistency requirement one level up: that one asks for a consistent factor per (product, uom, base_uom), this asks for a consistent base_uom per work unit.

Two dbt tests, at error severity
-- 1. The generated column is the only place the conversion happens. This is
--    cheap, and it is the column the Pareto's bars are drawn from — so if it
--    ever disagrees with its inputs, every bar on the screen is wrong.
SELECT work_unit_id, shift_date, shift, product_id, reason
  FROM {{ this }}
 WHERE converted_value IS DISTINCT FROM round(counter_value * factor_to_base, 3)

-- 2. Rejects reconcile with the shift report's own aggregate, or the gap is
--    explained. The screen's footnote PROMISES the reader these will not match,
--    because each row is scaled by its own factor while the tile is the ETL's
--    aggregate. That promise should rest on a measured number rather than a
--    guess: this test is what turns "they differ" into "they differ by X".
--    Set the threshold from what you actually observe; start by reporting it.
SELECT r.work_unit_id, r.shift_date, r.shift,
       sum(r.converted_value) AS ranked, w.reject AS aggregate
  FROM {{ this }} r
  JOIN oee.work_unit_shift_reports w
    ON w.work_unit_id = r.work_unit_id
   AND w.shift        = r.shift
   AND (w.date AT TIME ZONE r.time_zone)::date = r.shift_date
 GROUP BY 1,2,3, w.reject
HAVING sum(r.converted_value) IS DISTINCT FROM w.reject
Test 2 will fail on day one, and that is the point — it is the instrument that tells us how far apart the two sources are, which nobody currently knows. Report the number before deciding whether it is a threshold, a bug in the model, or a bug in the report table.

3.9 downtime_log_events — what must fill it (§24, §30)
0009_oee_downtime_log_events.sql adds one new table, and every row of it is missing. The Losses page's Others tab renders "not loaded yet" for every shift until you write it. Same trade 0007 and 0008 made, taken a third time.

Why a new table rather than a read of downtime_reports
This is the product decision, and it is normative rather than a preference. downtime_reports is the operator-mutable table: §1 rule 2 reserves editing a downtime — its category, its reasons, its actions — for this service, and 0004's row-level trigger plus 0007's downtime_report_history exist for that path and nothing else. A frequency Pareto drawn from it therefore moves when an operator corrects a stop.

"How often did this happen" and "how often do we currently say this happened" are two different questions, and only the second can be answered by a mutable table. A view over downtime_reports was considered and rejected: no projection of a mutable table is immutable, so it would inherit the defect with none of the cost saved.

Both readings now ship, on one page, from two tables — Availability / Schedule / Performance Loss from downtime_reports, Others from this log. They are allowed to disagree; that is the point of the split. Nobody knows by how much, which is what the second test below is for.

Grain and key
One row per downtime event, as logged. Upsert key event_id (pk_downtime_log_events).

Column	What it feeds on screen	Notes
event_id text	nothing directly — it is the identity behind every count	Deterministic, from the Silver event. The whole primary key. See §2.1 and the note below.
work_unit_id, shift_date, shift	the join to the shift report	shift_date is the shift's business day, per §3.1 — not a calendar day and not an instant.
reasons text[]	one bar per element	Every element counts. See below — this is the column with the most rules on it.
category oee.operation_type	nothing today	Nullable and unread: Others counts every stop. Carried so a later cut costs no migration.
work_unit_name	the machine behind the bars	NOT NULL. A Pareto row that cannot name its machine is not one.
work_unit_code, work_center_*, area_*	nothing today	Nullable, carried because free on an empty table — 0006's argument.
time_zone varchar(64)	nothing directly	The IANA zone shift_date was cut in. The only record of how the day was cut — see below.
reasons is a text[], and it is §3.3.1's ask rather than a second jsonb array
§3.3.1 asks for downtime_reports.reason to stop being a jsonb array. Shipping a brand-new table with the shape this document asks you to delete would be indefensible, so it does not. text[] answers all three of §3.3.1's complaints, and it answers them because this is a different read:

"The grouping key is an expression over jsonb." Here the grouping key is unnest's output — a plain text, comparable and indexable, not reason#>>'{0}'. §8 measured that expression at 2799 ms against 2111 ms for a real text column.
"Element order is load-bearing." It is irrelevant here, because this read counts every element rather than element 0. §3.3.1's second complaint exists precisely because ->> 0 discards the tail; nothing is discarded here.
"Non-string elements degrade silently." They are not representable: the element type is text, so the database rejects at write time what the jsonb reader has to guard against at read time.
So this is not a jsonb array in disguise. And §3.3.1's own preferred fix — a scalar primary_reason text — would be the wrong shape here, because a stop genuinely carries several reasons and this chart genuinely counts all of them. reasons text[] and primary_reason text are the same lesson applied to two different questions; asking for both is consistent.

'{}' means unattributed, and it is the only way to say it
ck_dtle_reasons rejects NULL and blank elements, so "no reason was recorded" has exactly one representation and cannot be confused with "a reason that happens to be empty". Contrast downtime_reports.reason, where '[]', '[""]', '["   "]' and a non-string element all mean the same thing and the reader has to fold four shapes into one.

Two further rules:

There is no DEFAULT on the column, unlike downtime_reports.reason DEFAULT '[]'. A model that forgets it must fail the load — with a default it would instead mark every stop unattributed, inflating exactly one bar to 100% while every real reason vanished, and nothing anywhere would error.
Trim your elements. ck_dtle_reasons rejects blanks but not '  Machine_Stop  '; the reader trims, so the fold is safe, but the untrimmed test below is what keeps it honest.
A duplicated element counts once — but do not write one
The reader explodes with SELECT DISTINCT event_id, reason, so {Material_Jam, Material_Jam} contributes 1. That makes a duplicate harmless, not correct: it is still an untruth about the event, and there is no constraint against it. The warn-severity test below reports them.

The table carries NO duration, and one rule follows from that
No duration, no start_at, no end_at, and no instant of any kind. Two classes of arithmetic disappear with them, and one obligation moves to you:

Nothing can be clipped. DowntimeReaderRepository.clipped computes LEAST(coalesce(end_at, now), window.to) - GREATEST(start_at, window.from) precisely because a stop straddles a shift boundary and its minutes have to be split. A count cannot be split.
So assign each event to exactly ONE (work_unit_id, shift_date, shift). Whichever side of midnight a boundary-crossing stop is filed under, its contribution is 1. The single-column primary key is the only mechanical guard: an event written under two shift assignments conflicts on the second write.
There is no open-stop case. coalesce(end_at, now()) has no analogue; a stop still in progress is already one event.
The honest cost, filed in Open risks: with no instant on the row, the shift assignment is not auditable from the data — event_id is the only route back to Silver. A nullable occurred_at timestamptz was deliberately left out on §3.3's ground, which is that a second representation of one fact eventually disagrees with the first. It stays cheap to add while the table is empty; ask if you want it.

Canonical reasons — the reader trims but does not case-fold
'Machine_Stop' and 'machine stop' are two bars. Same stability ask §3.8 makes of reject_count_wu_shift.reason, and for the same reason: a renamed vocabulary is a data migration rather than a model change. Tell us if it changes.

NEVER UPDATE and NEVER DELETE a row here
Append-only is not an optimisation, it is the table's reason to exist. If a stop is corrected upstream, write a new event or reload from Silver under the same event_id; do not mutate the log to match a corrected report. 0009's row-level audit trigger is what will say so if this is ever broken.

dbt config — and note the difference from §3.8
{
  {
    config(
    materialized='incremental',
    unique_key='event_id',
    incremental_strategy='merge',
    ),
  },
}
A naive merge is fine here, unlike on reject_count_wu_shift: nothing on this table is GENERATED, so there is no column a merge can fail on. delete+insert scoped on shift_date is equally acceptable if the run window is the natural unit. This is said explicitly so nobody copies §3.8's delete+insert note and assumes a generated-column trap that does not exist.

Three dbt tests — two at error, one at warn
-- 1. ERROR. No element is NULL, blank, or untrimmed.
--    ck_dtle_reasons enforces the first two, through an IMMUTABLE function --
--    because a CHECK admits no subquery. Postgres does NOT re-validate a CHECK
--    when the body of a function it calls is replaced, so this test is the
--    DURABLE half of that guard. The untrimmed case is not constrained at all and
--    would render two bars for one reason.
SELECT event_id
  FROM {{ this }}
 WHERE EXISTS (
   SELECT 1 FROM unnest(reasons) AS e(v)
    WHERE v IS NULL OR btrim(v) = '' OR v <> btrim(v)
 )

-- 2. ERROR. THE NUMBER NOBODY KNOWS, and the analogue of §3.8's second test.
--    Two tabs on ONE page now count the same physical stops through two tables:
--    Others from this immutable log, Availability/Schedule/Performance Loss from
--    the operator-mutable oee.downtime_reports. They are ALLOWED to disagree --
--    that is the point of the split -- but the magnitude is unmeasured. This is
--    what turns "they differ" into "they differ by X".
--    It compares per-shift COUNTS, which is the best it can do until
--    source_event_id is populated (§3.3.2); with that field it becomes an exact
--    anti-join and says which stops are missing rather than how many.
SELECT e.work_unit_id, e.shift_date, e.shift,
       count(*) AS logged_events,
       (SELECT count(*)
          FROM oee.downtime_reports d
         WHERE d.work_unit_id = e.work_unit_id
           AND d.shift        = e.shift
           AND (d.date AT TIME ZONE e.time_zone)::date = e.shift_date) AS reported_stops
  FROM {{ this }} e
 GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
HAVING count(*) IS DISTINCT FROM (
         SELECT count(*)
           FROM oee.downtime_reports d
          WHERE d.work_unit_id = e.work_unit_id
            AND d.shift        = e.shift
            AND (d.date AT TIME ZONE e.time_zone)::date = e.shift_date)

-- 3. WARN. A reason repeated inside one row. The reader counts it once, so this is
--    not an error -- it is a claim about an event that is not true.
SELECT event_id
  FROM {{ this }}
 WHERE cardinality(reasons) <> cardinality(ARRAY(SELECT DISTINCT unnest(reasons)))
Test 2 will fail on day one, and that is the point, exactly as it is for §3.8's second test. Report the number rather than suppressing it, and before deciding whether it is a threshold, a bug in this model, or a bug in downtime_reports.

4. The watermark — oee.etl_watermarks
Created by 0005_oee_etl_watermarks.sql. dbt stamps it, one row per Gold table, upserted per run.

Why it exists
Two shipped features currently answer a question they cannot answer, and both fail in the flattering direction:

An empty downtime_reports result renders as a full-width green RUN_TIME band. A shift that was down for hours and a shift whose rows have not loaded yet look identical (§8).
An empty product_count_wu_shift result renders "No product output recorded for this shift" — the same text a genuinely idle machine gets (§14).
Neither is resolvable from the data: a machine that ran a product with total_out = 0 is legitimate. The missing fact is about the data — has the pipeline reached this day yet?

The post-hook
Add to every Gold model. This is verified SQL — it was run against a real Postgres 18 before being written here:

{{ config(post_hook="
  INSERT INTO oee.etl_watermarks AS w
    (table_name, last_run_at, last_business_date, rows_total, run_id, writer)
  SELECT '{{ this.identifier }}', now(), max(business_date), count(*),
         '{{ invocation_id }}', 'dbt'
    FROM {{ this }}
  ON CONFLICT (table_name) DO UPDATE SET
    last_run_at        = EXCLUDED.last_run_at,
    last_business_date = EXCLUDED.last_business_date,
    rows_total         = EXCLUDED.rows_total,
    run_id             = EXCLUDED.run_id,
    writer             = EXCLUDED.writer
") }}
Until §3.1 lands there is no business_date column, so substitute per table:

Table	last_business_date before §3.1
product_count_wu_shift	max(shift_date) — already a real date
product_count_wu_day	max(date) — already a real date
product_perf_wu_hour	max(business_date) — already a real date
reject_count_wu_shift	max(shift_date) — already a real date
downtime_log_events	max(shift_date) — already a real date
the four timestamptz tables	max((date AT TIME ZONE '{{ var("plant_tz") }}')::date)
product_perf_wu_hour is the reason this row matters more than the others: its watermark is what lets the shift report's performance chart say "not loaded yet" instead of drawing an empty chart that reads as an idle machine. Without the row, that chart becomes the third surface to fail in the flattering direction, alongside the timeline and the SKU card described above.

reject_count_wu_shift needs this row more than any other table does. Its watermark is the only thing separating "this machine rejected nothing" from "the reject model has never run", and until you run it the second is true of every shift — so the tab is written to say so. Without the row the screen stays honest; with rows but no row here, it starts calling every loaded shift unloaded.

downtime_log_events needs it for exactly the same reason, and the sentence transfers word for word with two nouns changed: its watermark is the only thing separating "nothing stopped this machine" from "the event log has never run", and until you run it the second is true of every shift.

table_name is constrained by a CHECK to the nine real table names. That is deliberate: {{ this.identifier }} resolves to the dbt model name, and the models being ported are still called machine_shift_report / line_shift_report / sku_daily_report. Without the check, a renamed-but-not-repointed model would write a watermark under a key no reader looks at, and nothing would fail. If your insert is rejected, the model name is wrong, not the check.

rows_total is a whole-table count, not rows written by the run — dbt does not expose an affected-row count to a post-hook. Freshness comes from last_run_at.

A missing row means "never loaded", which is why nothing is seeded.

5. Write attribution — set application_name
0004_oee_write_audit.sql adds oee.write_audit and a trigger pair per table — 0006, 0007, 0008, 0009 and 0010 each carried the pair for the table they added, so twelve tables are audited today. Every writer is recorded with current_user, application_name, client address and timestamp.

Please connect with a distinct application_name — e.g. dbt-gold — otherwise both writers appear identically and the audit trail cannot separate a pipeline load from an operator edit.

For reference, the names this service reports:

application_name	What it means
mes-oee-monitor-gold	Ordinary reads. The overwhelming majority of its connections.
mes-oee-monitor-operator	A named operator mutation, set per transaction via SET LOCAL.
api-gold-migrate	scripts/migrate.mjs applying a migration.
So SELECT * FROM oee.write_audit WHERE application_name = 'mes-oee-monitor-operator' lists every operator write still within retention — see §5.1, which also says where to look for the trail that is kept permanently.

For dbt, set it in profiles.yml:

outputs:
  gold:
    type: postgres
    # ...
    search_path: oee
    application_name: dbt-gold
Cost is negligible and deliberately asymmetric: INSERTs are audited once per statement, not per row, because at the 500-work-unit target the pipeline writes ~18M downtime_reports rows a year and auditing each would double that write volume to record nothing anyone reads. UPDATEs and DELETEs are audited per row, carrying the primary key, because those are the operator path.

5.1 write_audit is partitioned by month, and pruned after a year
0012_oee_write_audit_partitioned.sql turned oee.write_audit into a table partitioned by RANGE on at, one partition per month. Nothing about how you write to it changes — you insert into oee.write_audit exactly as before, or rather you do not insert at all, because the triggers do it for you. Two things are worth knowing anyway.

Retention is twelve months, for every writer including the operator. Earlier drafts of this section proposed keeping operator rows forever, and that was reversed on a fact: those rows are not the durable record, and never were. The permanent operator trail is in two other tables, neither of which is pruned by anything, and both of which carry strictly more than write_audit does:

Table	What it keeps
oee.work_unit_shift_report_approval_events	by_subject, by_name, from_status, to_status, at
oee.downtime_report_history	changed_by, field, old_value, new_value, changed_at
write_audit says "the operator role touched a row"; those two say who changed which field from what to what. If you need to reason about an operator override — which §13 requires you to — read downtime_report_history, never write_audit. The latter is an incident-forensics log for the question "which database user wrote this, from where", which has a short useful life.

Pruning is SELECT * FROM oee.prune_write_audit() — it drops whole partitions rather than deleting rows, and returns what it dropped with a row count. Nothing runs it on a schedule yet: pg_cron is not installed on this cluster, which is bundled into the request in §6.

The one hazard, and it is yours as much as ours. A partitioned table rejects an insert for which no partition exists, and twelve tables' triggers write here — so a missing month would not degrade the audit log, it would fail every write to Gold, your loads included. 0012 therefore creates a DEFAULT partition as the guard, plus monthly partitions thirteen months back and twelve forward. A row for an uncovered month lands in DEFAULT instead of raising.

That safety net has a cost worth checking occasionally, because Postgres refuses to attach a new partition whose range overlaps rows already sitting in DEFAULT:

SELECT * FROM oee.write_audit_default_backlog();
A non-empty result means that month's partition can no longer be created with one DDL statement — those rows have to be moved first. Empty is the expected state.

6. Proposed database roles
Today every connection is the webadmin superuser with a blank application_name, and no table in the oee schema carries any grant at all — checked 2026-08-26, relacl is NULL on all 14. Requested of whoever administers the cluster:

Role	Grants	Used by
oee_etl	INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on the pipeline-owned tables; USAGE on the sequences	Airflow / dbt
oee_app	SELECT on oee.*; UPDATE on the mutation columns of downtime_reports; INSERT, UPDATE on the three operator-owned tables, plus USAGE on their sequences	mes-oee-monitor
The oee_app row previously read "SELECT on oee.*; UPDATE on the mutation columns only", and that grant cannot execute the features this service now ships. Approving a report inserts into work_unit_shift_report_approvals and work_unit_shift_report_approval_events; editing a downtime will insert into downtime_report_history. All three are tables this service owns outright, so the INSERT is not a widening of its reach into pipeline data — but implemented as originally written, the first approve would fail at the database with a permission error.

oee_etl is narrowed in the same amendment: oee.* would have given the pipeline write access to the three operator-owned tables, which §12 exists to prevent.

Amended 2026-08-25. oee_etl needs SELECT on oee.downtime_report_history — the override join in §13 reads it on every run. Narrowed as originally written, that join fails with a permission error the first time the model runs, which is at least loud. INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE on that table stay off the pipeline's grant, which is the half worth keeping.

This is what makes §5 trustworthy — an application_name is self-reported, a role is not.

6.1 Also requested: pg_cron
Checked on this cluster and not installed — neither is pg_partman. webadmin is a superuser, so the failure is genuinely "the extension is absent", not a permissions problem.

It is wanted for one job: SELECT * FROM oee.prune_write_audit() monthly, which is what makes §5.1's twelve-month retention actually happen rather than merely being documented. Until it exists somebody runs that by hand, and the consequence of forgetting is an audit table that grows without bound — slow, not dangerous.

Bundled here rather than filed separately because it goes to the same administrator as the roles above, and asking twice is worse than asking once.

7. poc-flink-v2 — NOT being ported (kept as a vocabulary map only)
This section is obsolete as an instruction. It was written on the assumption that molca-id/poc-flink-v2 would be ported to this vocabulary. It will not be: the pipeline owner has confirmed it is an older implementation for a different project, and a new pipeline is being written for mes-oee-monitor (§16.10 Q10). Nothing below should be read as "do this". The table is retained because the vocabulary mapping is still a useful Rosetta stone when someone reads the old models, and because the DAG schedule note underneath it is independently true.

In particular, do not port line_shift_report — see the note at the end of this section.

molca-id/poc-flink-v2 implements a similar pipeline for the previous vocabulary. The mapping, for reference only:

In poc-flink-v2	Here
103.185.38.172:5442, db gold, schema public	mes-master-data cluster, schema oee
dbt_project.yml → name: 'ajinomoto_gold'	scoped to the work_unit vocabulary
machine_shift_report	work_unit_shift_reports
line_shift_report	no direct equivalent — see note below
sku_daily_report	product_count_wu_day
line / machine	work_center / work_unit
report_shift_aggregation_dag.py already runs 0 0,8,16 * * * for shifts ending 07:00 / 15:00 / 23:00 WIB, which matches SHIFT_WINDOWS in apps/api/src/module/downtime/downtime.ts exactly. No change needed there.

Note on line-level grain — SETTLED, AND THE ANSWER IS §16. This note used to say "do not port line_shift_report until that is settled". It is settled twice over: the grain now exists, and the porting question is moot because nothing is being ported (see the banner above). 0014 adds oee.work_center_{shift,day,month}_reports, and §16 is the specification. Read it before porting anything, because the target's keys and its unit rule both differ from line_shift_report's — and §16.10 Q10 asks you to check one thing about the old model specifically: if it averages rates, or divides by wall clock rather than by machine-time, do not port it.

What is NOT settled is the SKU half, and the distinction is the whole reason 0014 was possible. The OEE measures roll up across machines cleanly — durations and counts add, rates are recomputed from the sums. Per-product counts do not: factor_to_base differs per product, so summing across work units has to happen after conversion to the base unit, and the "Finish Good stays in its production unit" rule stops being expressible once two machines count the same SKU in different units. So sku_daily_report at line grain remains an open product question, and 0014 does not answer it — these three tables carry no per-product rows at all.

8. Store decision — measured 2026-08-13
Verdict: keep plain Postgres. Do not move Gold to a TimescaleDB columnstore. If ad-hoc BI becomes a real requirement, mirror only the two large tables into ClickHouse for BI and leave serving and mutations where they are.

This reverses the expectation the benchmark set out to confirm. The columnstore was the favourite going in — same SQL, same driver, already in the stack for Bronze/Silver, and named for Gold by the KAIDO spec. It measured badly enough on the paths this product actually uses that the assumption did not survive.

Method
One year at 500 work units, generated deterministically (no random(), so every engine got identical data): 547,500 shift reports, 1,642,500 product-count rows, 18,067,500 downtime rows. Both Postgres variants ran on the same TimescaleDB PG17 server — same binary, same settings — so the only variable between them is heap versus hypertable-plus-columnstore. Median of 7 server-side timings via \timing, after one discarded warm-up, so client startup is excluded. Queries A-E are the real ones this API issues; F-H are representative ad-hoc BI.

Storage
Table	plain PG	Timescale columnstore	ClickHouse

Why the columnstore loses
Two independent effects, both isolated by measurement:

Chunk fan-out. GET /work-units/shift-reports/:id looks a report up by its surrogate id and nothing else — the URL carries no date. On a hypertable there is no partitioning column in that predicate, so no chunk can be excluded: the plan referenced 39 chunk nodes. Adding a one-month date predicate to the same lookup dropped it from 96 ms to 16 ms. The API cannot supply that date without changing the route, so this penalty is structural, not a tuning mistake.
Decompression on the hot path. Even with chunk exclusion working, the same lookup was 16 ms against 0.4 ms on the heap — 40x — because the row lives in a compressed columnar chunk.
A "compress only chunks older than 30 days" policy would soften effect 2 for recent data, but not effect 1, and every report older than the window pays both. Meanwhile the upside never arrived: the three BI queries were a wash (-5% to +8%). These are aggregate tables of a few hundred megabytes; plain Postgres already scans them fast, and columnar storage had nothing to win back.

Timescale also forces a schema change: every unique index must contain the partitioning column, so work_unit_shift_reports_pkey and downtime_reports_pkey have to widen to (id, date) and (id, start_at).

Where the real BI ceiling is
The one genuinely slow query is the plant-year downtime Pareto at 2.8 s, and ClickHouse does it in 390 ms (7x). That is a real gap, and it is the only result that argues for a columnar engine at all. Two things to know before reaching for one:

jsonb is a minor part of it. Grouping on a plain text column instead of extracting reason#>>'{0}' took the Pareto from 2799 ms to 2111 ms — about 25%. The remaining 2.1 s is scanning 3.5 GB. Normalising reason is worth doing, but it is not the fix.
ClickHouse is not disqualified on latency. Its point lookup by id was 4 ms and its mutations 0.2-0.4 s, both usable. It is disqualified for the serving role on semantics: mutations are asynchronous by default, so an operator who approves a report and immediately reloads can read the old value, and there are no transactions to update a row and write its audit entry atomically. Approvals need read-after-write; BI does not.
Recommendation, in order
Stay on plain Postgres for all seven tables. Every query this API issues is under 1 ms, and both mutation paths are under 100 ms.
Before considering another engine, take the cheap wins: normalise reason out of jsonb (~25% of the Pareto), add the range index in §10, and add monthly roll-up tables if BI settles on a few known shapes. Any of these beats a migration.
If ad-hoc BI becomes a firm requirement, mirror only downtime_reports and product_perf_wu_hour into ClickHouse, served by the same dbt project. Serving and mutations stay in Postgres. That buys the 7x where it matters and touches no shipped read path. product_perf_wu_hour projects to roughly 6.6M rows/year (500 work units × 24 h × 365 d × ~1.5 products per hour) — about a third of downtime_reports, so it is the second table worth mirroring and small enough that recommendation 1 is unaffected. Its loaded_at column exists so that mirror can be extracted incrementally without CDC.
Revisit when row counts approach the projection. The live table held 8 rows on 2026-08-13.
Caveats
Synthetic data is more regular than production, so all three compression ratios are optimistic. Both Postgres variants ran on PG17 (production is 18.4). One year at 500 work units — ratios should hold as volume grows, absolutes scale roughly linearly. Only downtime_reports was loaded into ClickHouse, so its column is partly blank by design: the point was to size the BI ceiling and the mutation semantics, not to port the whole schema.

9. What changed in 0006
0006_oee_product_perf_wu_hour.sql swaps one table for another. Read this before your next model run.

Added	oee.product_perf_wu_hour — work unit × local hour × product
Dropped	oee.work_unit_perf_analytics (and its audit triggers, and its watermark row)
Altered	ck_etl_watermarks_table — same seven names, one substituted
Why the swap rather than a fix in place
work_unit_perf_analytics was keyed on an arbitrary start_time..end_time interval. Five things followed, and all five are fixed by re-graining rather than by adding columns: nothing forbade two rows overlapping, so no aggregate over it was safe; it had no natural key, so it was half of §2.1; it carried no business day and no shift, so "one shift of one work unit" was not expressible; its measures were numeric(10,3) where every sibling table uses numeric(15,3) for the same quantities; and it had no work_center_id, so no question above the work unit could be asked without joining another database.

It had no reader in this repo and the whole Gold schema held 8 hand-seeded rows, so this was the cheapest it will ever be.

What you need to do
Confirm no work_unit_perf_analytics model exists on your laptop. This is the one thing nobody here could check.
Name the new model product_perf_wu_hour. {{ this.identifier }} is what ck_etl_watermarks_table sees; a mismatched name fails the watermark insert loudly, which is the point of the check.
Read §3.5 (the master rate, and the GENERATED-column trap that breaks a naive merge), §3.6 (local-clock bucketing — the highest-risk instruction in this document) and §3.7 (the three tests).
unique_key=['work_unit_id', 'bucket_start', 'product_id'], incremental_strategy='delete+insert'.
The DDL was applied to a throwaway PostgreSQL 18.4 and exercised before this was written: the generated columns, all ten CHECKs, ON CONFLICT idempotency, the audit triggers and both watermark outcomes. The merge-strategy failure in §3.5 is a reproduction, not a prediction.

10. What 0008 adds
0008_oee_reject_count_wu_shift.sql adds one table and widens one constraint. Read this before your next model run, and read §3.8 before writing the model.

Added	oee.reject_count_wu_shift — work unit × shift day × shift × product × reason
Altered	ck_etl_watermarks_table — seven names becomes eight
Dropped	nothing
Nothing existing changes shape, so no model you have today breaks. The table is new and empty.

Why a new table rather than columns on product_count_wu_shift
That table's grain is (work_unit, shift_date, shift, product). A reject reason is a fifth key member, so adding one would re-grain every existing row — a migration plus a backfill against a live table, and a silent doubling of every SKU View figure for any consumer that missed the change. A separate table at its own grain leaves the SKU read untouched, and it is the cheapest this will ever be: the whole schema still holds a handful of hand-seeded rows.

What you need to do
Name the model reject_count_wu_shift. {{ this.identifier }} is what ck_etl_watermarks_table sees; a mismatched name fails the watermark insert loudly, which is the point of the check.
unique_key=['work_unit_id', 'shift_date', 'shift', 'product_id', 'reason'], incremental_strategy='delete+insert'. Not a naive merge — converted_value is GENERATED and a merge fails on it. §3.8 has the config block.
Write NULL weights, never 0. §3.8 explains what breaks otherwise, and it breaks in three places at once.
Do not write converted_value. Postgres computes it.
Decide what goes in reason — it is a primary-key member and must be stable across runs.
Add the §4 watermark post-hook, substituting max(shift_date).
Add the two tests in §3.8. The second one will fail on day one; report the number rather than suppressing it.
Tell us the base-unit story. If a work unit's counters can convert to more than one base unit, the converted column stops being comparable and the screen says so — see §3.8. We would rather know now than render an em dash at a supervisor.
The DDL was applied to a throwaway PostgreSQL and exercised before this was written: the generated column rejects an explicit assignment, all six CHECKs reject the rows they are meant to, ON CONFLICT on the five key columns restates rather than duplicates, both audit triggers fire (statement-level for INSERT, row-level with the full composite key for UPDATE/DELETE), and the widened watermark check accepts reject_count_wu_shift while still rejecting a typo of it.

11. What 0009 adds
0009_oee_downtime_log_events.sql adds one table plus one helper function, and widens one constraint. Read this before your next model run, and read §3.9 before writing the model.

Added	oee.downtime_log_events — one machine stop, as logged (immutable)
Added	oee.text_array_has_blank(text[]) — an IMMUTABLE helper, because a CHECK admits no subquery
Altered	ck_etl_watermarks_table — eight names becomes nine
Dropped	nothing
Nothing existing changes shape, so no model you have today breaks. The table is new and empty.

Why a new table rather than reading downtime_reports
That table is the one operators edit (§1 rule 2), so a frequency Pareto over it moves when a stop is corrected — and a count of what happened cannot depend on what someone currently says about it. On top of that, §2.1 means downtime_reports is loaded DELETE-then-INSERT, so every id changes on every run; counting rows whose identity is re-minted nightly is not counting. A view was considered and rejected: no projection of a mutable table is immutable.

What you need to do
Name the model downtime_log_events. {{ this.identifier }} is what ck_etl_watermarks_table sees; a mismatched name fails the watermark insert loudly, which is the point of the check.
unique_key='event_id'. A naive merge is fine here — nothing on this table is GENERATED, unlike reject_count_wu_shift (§3.8). delete+insert scoped on shift_date is equally acceptable. §3.9 has the config block.
Carry a deterministic event_id from the Silver event. It is the whole primary key. Write the same string into downtime_reports.source_event_id (§3.3.2) and §2.1 closes on both tables at once — that is one field, and it is also what makes test 2 below able to say anything precise.
Write reasons as a real text[] — one element per reason recorded, no NULL and no blank elements, trimmed, '{}' for a stop with no reason attributed. Do not write duplicates.
Assign each event to exactly ONE (work_unit_id, shift_date, shift). The table carries no timestamps, so nothing can clip a boundary-crossing stop and nothing can re-derive the day. §3.9 explains why the single-column primary key is the only mechanical guard.
Never UPDATE and never DELETE a row here. Append-only is not an optimisation, it is the table's reason to exist. The row-level audit trigger will say so if it happens.
Use the canonical reason vocabulary. The reader trims; it does not case-fold, so 'machine stop' and 'Machine_Stop' are two bars.
Add the §4 watermark post-hook, substituting max(shift_date). Without it the Others tab says "not loaded yet" however many events you write.
Add the three tests in §3.9. The second will fail on day one; report the number rather than suppressing it.
Tell us whether a stop can legitimately carry no reasons, and how often. That is what the Unspecified bar actually means, and we would rather know now than explain it to a supervisor.
Tell us if you want occurred_at. It was deliberately left out (§3.9) and is cheap to add while the table is empty. Ask before it stops being cheap.
The DDL has been APPLIED and READ but not yet exercised. It is live on the dev Gold database and the Others tab renders from it (TODOS.md §30 records the walkthrough), so the table, the helper function, the index and the watermark row all work for the read path. That proves nothing about what the table REJECTS, and every guard in 0009 is about rejection — so this is deliberately not the paragraph 0008 and 0009's equivalents carry. What a first proper run on a throwaway still owes: every CHECK rejecting the rows it must (especially ck_dtle_reasons, whose predicate lives in a function precisely because the inline form is illegal, and ck_dtle_reasons_1d, which must admit array_ndims('{}') being NULL), ON CONFLICT (event_id) restating rather than duplicating, both audit triggers firing, and the widened watermark check accepting downtime_log_events while still rejecting a typo of it. The dev seed carries commented-out blank-element and 2-D blocks for exactly that.

12. What 0010 adds — and why there is nothing for you to do
0010_oee_shift_report_approvals.sql adds two tables:

Table	Grain	Written by
work_unit_shift_report_approvals	one work unit × shift (current state)	mes-oee-monitor only
work_unit_shift_report_approval_events	one approval transition	mes-oee-monitor only
Neither is part of the nine, and this section asks nothing of you. It exists so that when you see two new tables in oee, you know they are not yours and know why.

Do not model these
No dbt model, no source, no snapshot, no test. They hold no data derived from Silver.
No etl_watermarks row. ck_etl_watermarks_table was deliberately not extended to include them, so a post_hook stamping {{ this.identifier }} for a model of either name fails loudly. That is intentional: it is the mechanical version of this paragraph. If your watermark insert is rejected with ck_etl_watermarks_table, you have a model pointed at a table this service owns — the fix is to remove the model, not to amend the constraint.
What they are for, briefly
Approving a shift report is one of the two named operator mutations in §1 rule 2. It moves a report open → closed and records who did it and when.

The one thing that concerns you, and it is a warning
Approval state is keyed on (work_unit_id, date, shift) — the columns of wu_shift_report_key — and deliberately not on work_unit_shift_reports.id.

That is a defence against your loader, and it is worth being explicit about why:

work_unit_shift_reports.id is a serial you do not supply. A delete+insert load — which §9 recommends to you for product_perf_wu_hour, and which §2.1 mandates for downtime_reports — deletes the row and re-inserts it with a new id.
Had approval state been columns on that row, such a load would have silently destroyed an operator's approval and broken every deep link at the same time. Nothing would error; the report would simply read "open" again.
Keyed on the natural key, the approval reattaches to the restated row. Your loader can restate work_unit_shift_reports as often as it likes.
So the ask is only this: keep upserting work_unit_shift_reports on wu_shift_report_key, as §2 already says. If that key is ever changed, or a row is re-keyed to a different (work_unit_id, date, shift), its approval orphans — harmlessly, but invisibly. Tell us before changing it. To find orphans:

SELECT a.* FROM oee.work_unit_shift_report_approvals a
 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM oee.work_unit_shift_reports r
                    WHERE r.work_unit_id = a.work_unit_id
                      AND r.date = a.date AND r.shift = a.shift);
13. Editing a downtime — the one change you must make to your model
This is the only section in this document that asks you to change a model you have already written, and it is not optional. Everything else here is a request for a column or a test. This one describes a way your next ordinary run will destroy an operator's work, silently, with nothing in any log to show it happened.

mes-oee-monitor now ships the second of the two named operator mutations in §1 rule 2: PATCH /api/v1/downtimes/:sourceEventId changes a stop's category, reason, detail_reason and actions. It writes one row per changed field into oee.downtime_report_history — a table §2 already tells you not to touch — inside the same transaction as the UPDATE.

The problem, in four lines
An operator corrects a stop: category UNPLANNED → PLANNED. The UPDATE lands.
Your next run loads downtime_reports from Silver, which knows nothing about that correction.
§2.1 mandates DELETE-then-INSERT scoped to the run window, so the corrected row is deleted and the machine's original values are re-inserted.
The chart goes back to what it said before. Nothing errors. The operator's correction is gone and the only trace is a history row nobody is looking at.
Switching to an upsert does not fix this. Once you populate source_event_id and the model becomes ON CONFLICT (source_event_id) DO UPDATE, excluded.category overwrites the operator's value just as thoroughly. The load strategy is not the problem; re-deriving those four columns from Silver on every run is.

What you need to do
Apply the operator's overrides when you build the row. The trail is the source of truth for the four mutable columns; Silver is the source of truth for everything else on the table.

The current override for a stop is the LATEST history row per field:

WITH latest AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT ON (source_event_id, field)
         source_event_id, field, new_value
    FROM oee.downtime_report_history
   ORDER BY source_event_id, field, changed_at DESC, id DESC
),
override AS (
  SELECT source_event_id,
         (array_agg(new_value) FILTER (WHERE field = 'category'))[1]      AS category,
         (array_agg(new_value) FILTER (WHERE field = 'reason'))[1]        AS reason,
         (array_agg(new_value) FILTER (WHERE field = 'actions'))[1]       AS actions,
         (array_agg(new_value) FILTER (WHERE field = 'detail_reason'))[1] AS detail_reason,
         bool_or(field = 'category')      AS has_category,
         bool_or(field = 'reason')        AS has_reason,
         bool_or(field = 'actions')       AS has_actions,
         bool_or(field = 'detail_reason') AS has_detail_reason
    FROM latest
   GROUP BY source_event_id
)
array_agg(...)[1] is a pivot, not an aggregate: DISTINCT ON has already reduced latest to one row per (source_event_id, field), so there is exactly one value to take.

And it is array_agg(...)[1] rather than the more obvious max(...) because THERE IS NO max(jsonb) IN POSTGRES. max() is defined for numbers, text, dates and a few more, not for jsonb — so the max() version of this CTE fails outright with function max(jsonb) does not exist. That is at least a loud failure rather than a silent one, but it costs a debugging session, so it is called out here. (This document carried the max() version briefly; it was corrected once the query was actually executed against Postgres 16 rather than read.)

Then, in the model that builds downtime_reports:

SELECT s.*,
       CASE WHEN o.has_category
            THEN (o.category #>> '{}')::oee.operation_type
            ELSE s.category END                                   AS category,
       CASE WHEN o.has_reason        THEN o.reason        ELSE s.reason        END AS reason,
       CASE WHEN o.has_actions       THEN o.actions       ELSE s.actions       END AS actions,
       CASE WHEN o.has_detail_reason
            THEN o.detail_reason #>> '{}'
            ELSE s.detail_reason END                              AS detail_reason
  FROM {{ ref('silver_downtime') }} s
  LEFT JOIN override o ON o.source_event_id = s.source_event_id
Three things in that SQL that are easy to get wrong
CASE WHEN has_x, never COALESCE. An operator can legitimately CLEAR detail_reason to nothing, and the endpoint stores that as a jsonb null. COALESCE(o.detail_reason, s.detail_reason) would treat "the operator deliberately emptied this" as "the operator said nothing" and put the machine's text back. The has_* flags are the only way to tell an override to NULL apart from no override at all.

#>> '{}' for the two scalars, never ::text. category and detail_reason are stored as jsonb STRINGS, so new_value::text yields "PLANNED" with the quotes included and the cast to oee.operation_type fails with a message that points at the enum rather than at the quoting. #>> '{}' extracts the text unquoted. reason and actions are jsonb arrays already and go across as-is.

Join on source_event_id, which means this section depends on §3.3.2. Until you populate that column the history table cannot attach to anything, so the endpoint refuses every stop and there is nothing to override — the override join is correct and inert. The day you populate it, this join becomes load-bearing in the same run. Please land the two together.

Precedence: the operator wins, and it is worth saying why
If an operator sets category to PLANNED and a LATER upstream correction sets it to SMALL_STOP, this projection keeps PLANNED. That is deliberate. The operator is a human looking at the machine and correcting the pipeline; a rule that let the pipeline win would make the edit feature pointless the first time Silver was re-derived. Both values remain visible in oee.downtime_report_history — the old value, the new value, who and when — so nothing is lost, and a genuine upstream correction that matters can be applied by editing the stop again.

Any override layer has to answer this question. It is answered here, once, so nobody has to infer it from a COALESCE.

Finding rows where the override was not applied
The reconciliation query, in §12's spirit. A non-empty result means a run built these rows without the join above:

WITH latest AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT ON (source_event_id, field) source_event_id, field, new_value
    FROM oee.downtime_report_history
   ORDER BY source_event_id, field, changed_at DESC, id DESC
)
SELECT d.source_event_id, l.field, l.new_value AS should_be,
       CASE l.field
         WHEN 'category'      THEN to_jsonb(d.category::text)
         WHEN 'detail_reason' THEN to_jsonb(d.detail_reason)
         WHEN 'reason'        THEN d.reason
         WHEN 'actions'       THEN d.actions
       END AS actually_is
  FROM latest l
  JOIN oee.downtime_reports d USING (source_event_id)
 WHERE CASE l.field
         WHEN 'category'      THEN l.new_value #>> '{}' IS DISTINCT FROM d.category::text
         WHEN 'detail_reason' THEN l.new_value #>> '{}' IS DISTINCT FROM d.detail_reason
         WHEN 'reason'        THEN l.new_value IS DISTINCT FROM d.reason
         WHEN 'actions'       THEN l.new_value IS DISTINCT FROM d.actions
       END;
Re-applying the projection repairs it. It is idempotent, so running it twice is harmless.

Every statement in this section has been executed against Postgres 16, not only written down — the projection, the reconciliation query, and the round trip of "restate the row, re-apply the override, confirm it heals" are all asserted in apps/api/src/module/downtime/downtime-repository.integration.test.ts. That is deliberate: the first draft of this section did not run, and the reason it did not was invisible from reading it.

One dbt test, at error severity
Ship the reconciliation above as a singular test. It is the only mechanical guard that this section was honoured — the failure mode is a chart that quietly reverts, and no schema constraint can express "this column should hold what a different table's latest row says".

-- tests/downtime_overrides_applied.sql
-- Fails if any operator edit is not reflected in downtime_reports. A row here means
-- a run rebuilt the table without the override join in gold-write-contract.md §13,
-- and an operator's correction has been silently discarded.
What is NOT asked of you
Do not write oee.downtime_report_history. Read it in the projection above; never insert, update or delete. It is mes-oee-monitor's, like the two approval tables.
No etl_watermarks row for it, and ck_etl_watermarks_table will reject one — the same mechanical enforcement §12 describes.
downtime_log_events is untouched by any of this, and that is the point of it being a separate table. §3.9 says never UPDATE and never DELETE there; an operator correcting a stop does not change what was OBSERVED, so the Others tab deliberately does not move when the Availability Pareto does.
Nothing about recalculation, yet. Changing a stop's category moves time between schedule loss and availability loss, so the aggregates in work_unit_shift_reports are stale until your next run recomputes them. Today the browser simply says so and waits for the scheduled run. A mechanism for asking you to recompute one report sooner is sketched in downtime-edit-trd.md and is not built and not agreed — please read it and tell us whether the shape is workable before anyone implements it.
14. What 0011 adds — a shape guard that can FAIL YOUR LOAD
0011_oee_downtime_reason_shape.sql adds three CHECK constraints to oee.downtime_reports and one IMMUTABLE helper function. Read this one even though it asks nothing of you, because it changes what happens when a model writes a malformed label: it used to render a slightly wrong chart, and now it aborts the statement.

Constraint	Rejects
ck_downtime_reports_reason	reason that is not a jsonb ARRAY of non-blank strings ≤ 255 chars
ck_downtime_reports_actions	the same, on actions
ck_downtime_reports_detail_reason	detail_reason longer than 2000 characters
oee.jsonb_is_label_array(jsonb, int) is the predicate. It exists because a CHECK admits no subquery, and it is the jsonb counterpart to oee.text_array_has_blank(text[]), which 0009 added for the same reason on downtime_log_events.reasons.

Why now, and why this is the same call §3.9 already made
Those two columns were pipeline-written only until 2026-08-25, when the downtime-edit endpoint shipped (§13). A second writer arrived, and its validation protects itself and nothing else — a repair script, a psql session, or your model bypasses it entirely.

This is deliberately the trade §3.9 already made for reasons, where the column has no DEFAULT specifically so "a forgetful model fails the load". It is also what §3.3 has been asking for on this very table: "inverted rows are currently possible, and this service drops them at runtime… Rejecting at the source beats counting." Same argument, applied to labels.

What it will and will not reject
Tolerated, and each one deliberately:

An empty array. [] is the unlabelled Pareto bucket, which the read path handles explicitly.
Duplicate elements. §3.9 records that a duplicate "counts once — but do not write one". The reader is specified to cope, so rejecting them here would be a contract change dressed as a constraint. The edit endpoint dedupes on the way in; the database tolerates what you send.
Case variants. §3.9: the reader "trims but does not case-fold", so Machine_Stop and machine_stop are two reasons by design.
NULL detail_reason. That is what "the operator cleared this" looks like, and §13's CASE WHEN exists to preserve exactly it.
Rejected: a non-array value, a non-string element, a blank or whitespace-only element, a label over 255 characters, a detail_reason over 2000.

What you need to do
Nothing, if your model already writes clean string arrays. The live table was surveyed before the constraint was added — all 17 rows passed, with no non-arrays, no non-string elements, no blanks, no untrimmed values and the longest array at 3 elements — so it applied without a rewrite.
btrim your labels before writing them, if there is any chance Silver carries padding. A trailing space is now an aborted statement rather than a duplicate-looking Pareto bar.
Expect a hard failure rather than a bad chart if a label is empty. That is the point, and it is the same behaviour ck_dtle_reasons already gives you on downtime_log_events.
Tell us if 255 or 2000 is too short for anything real. Both are bounds this service chose to match its own input validation, not measurements of your data.
The bug this closes, which is worth one paragraph
A non-string element did not merely mis-group a bar. toStringList drops it on READ, so the row comes back as [] — the browser then sends [] as the optimistic-concurrency baseline for an edit, reason = '[]'::jsonb matches nothing, and the stop becomes permanently uneditable, telling the operator on every attempt that the pipeline reloaded it. The round trip through the read path is what loses the original, so no guard in the write path could recover it. This constraint is the only place it can be stopped.

Note that §3.3.1 — replacing reason with an indexable primary_reason text column — would make this section, the reader's defensive normalisation and the constraint all unnecessary at once. If that is on your roadmap, say so and this becomes throwaway work rather than a foundation.

15. What 0013 adds — the day and month tables become real, and they need you
This is the section to read first if you are picking up the work_unit_* DAG. Until now oee.work_unit_day_reports and oee.work_unit_month_reports appeared in this document only as two rows in §2's grain table. mes-oee-monitor now reads both — the By Day and By Monthly report screens — and they are still empty, so those screens render an empty state until your models exist.

Migration 0013 changed both tables while they were empty, precisely so that none of this costs you a coordinated deploy later.

15.1 The misspelling is gone — availablity_loss_time → availability_loss_time
Both tables spelled it without the second i; the shift table always spelled it correctly. 0013 renamed the two, so all three report tables now use availability_loss_time.

This document and this repo previously told you the misspelling had to be preserved forever. That instruction was conditional on something that turned out not to exist — dbt models already writing those columns. If you have a model in progress that writes availablity_loss_time, this is the one change in 0013 that will break it, and it will break loudly with an "column does not exist" error rather than silently. Please say so now if that is the case and we will reinstate the old name as a view or reverse the rename; it is cheap today and expensive after your first load.

15.2 Five columns added to both tables
Column	Type	Notes
business_date	date	The plant-local business day this row summarises. See §15.3.
time_zone	text	IANA zone, e.g. Asia/Jakarta. Same value as the one you already write to reject_count_wu_shift.time_zone.
work_center_id	integer	The line. Denormalised exactly as on work_unit_shift_reports.
work_center_name	varchar(255)	
work_center_code	varchar(255)	
mttr	bigint	Mean time to repair, milliseconds. See §15.4.
mtbf	bigint	Mean time between failures, milliseconds.
All are nullable in the DDL so the migration was instant, but the contract is that you write every one of them. work_center_id in particular: without it the downtime edit dialog cannot scope its Reason catalogue to the line, and a stop on the filler gets offered a palletiser reason.

15.3 What business_date must mean, and the day boundary
This is the ask §3.1 already made, now with a definite answer for these two tables.

A business day runs 07:00 → 07:00 plant-local, because shift 1 starts at 07:00 and shift 3 ends at 07:00 the next day. So the business day 2026-08-01 is the interval

[ 2026-08-01 07:00 plant-local , 2026-08-02 07:00 plant-local )
and it contains shift 1 and shift 2 of Aug 1 plus shift 3 of Aug 1, which ends on Aug 2. A day report's business_date is the date on the left of that interval. A month report's business_date is the first business day of the month — 2026-08-01 for August — not the last, and not midnight of the first.

Do the arithmetic in Postgres date/time types with AT TIME ZONE, not by adding hours to a timestamp. The offset differs across a DST transition, and a month window that adds 24 * n hours is silently one hour wrong twice a year — which changes the availability denominator and renders a plausible chart rather than failing.

One consequence of the 07:00 boundary is genuinely counter-intuitive, and you will reproduce it only if you do the arithmetic this way. A DST transition at 02:00 local falls inside the business day that began at 07:00 on the previous calendar day. Measured against Postgres for America/Chicago in 2026, where the clocks move on Mar 8 and Nov 1:

business day 2026-03-07   23 h   <- owns the spring-forward hour
business day 2026-03-08   24 h
business day 2026-10-31   25 h   <- owns the fall-back hour
business day 2026-11-01   24 h

month 2026-03            743 h
month 2026-10            745 h   <- November's transition is attributed HERE
month 2026-11            720 h
Read the October row twice. The clocks change on November 1st, but the November month window does not open until 07:00 that morning — five hours too late — so the extra hour belongs to October. Anyone eyeballing a monthly report would expect the reverse, and an implementation that trims the hour from November will match intuition and disagree with the plant. mes-oee-monitor asserts all six of these figures in apps/api/src/shared/shift-window.integration.test.ts.

The plant is Asia/Jakarta today, which is UTC+7 with no DST, so none of this bites yet — which is exactly why it is written down now rather than discovered at the first plant that does observe it.

date stays as it is, and the upsert keys still use it — wu_day_report_key (date, work_unit_id) and wu_month_report_key (date, month, work_unit_id) are unchanged. business_date is additional, and it is what every read filters and joins on.

business_date and time_zone were also added to work_unit_shift_reports, nullable, for the same reason. That table holds rows, so it needs a backfill — see §3.1 for the defect this fixes and the measured example of the month filter getting it wrong.

15.4 mttr and mtbf — and why they must be NULL rather than 0
Both are in milliseconds, matching work_unit_shift_reports.mttr / .mtbf.

On the shift table these are NOT NULL DEFAULT 0. On the day and month tables they are nullable with no default, deliberately, and please do not ask us to add one. The screens render 0 as 00 s — a measurement — and NULL as an em dash, meaning "not computed". A DEFAULT 0 would make every unwritten row claim a perfect repair time. Until your model computes them, NULL is the correct and honest value, and the screen already handles it.

Use the same definition of "failure" you use for the shift table. That definition lives in your model and nowhere else — mes-oee-monitor deliberately does not derive MTTR or MTBF from downtime_reports, because a second definition in the API would disagree with the shift report on the next screen over.

15.5 The roll-up rules — which measures add, and which must not be averaged
Both tables carry the same ~40 measures as the shift table, and getting this wrong produces numbers that look right. The rule:

Additive — sum them. Every *_time column, runtime, total_out, good_out, effective_out, reject, rework. A day is the sum of its three shifts; a month is the sum of its days.
NOT additive — recompute from the summed components, never average. oee, teep, availability, performance, quality. avg(availability) over 30 days is wrong, and it is wrong in the flattering direction — §3.5 works the arithmetic on the analogous rate case and gets 1333.3/h against a true 1024.4/h.
mttr / mtbf are ratios and fall in the second group: recompute from total repair time and total failure count, do not average the shift values.
mes-oee-monitor ships a seed script, apps/api/scripts/seed/0013_day_month_reports_dev.sql, that derives day and month rows from work_unit_shift_reports using exactly these rules. It is executable and you should read it as the specification — it is what the integration suite's cross-check asserts against.

15.6 One dbt test, at error severity
The single invariant worth failing a load over:

-- A day report must equal the sum of its shift reports, and a month the sum of its days.
select d.work_unit_id, d.business_date, d.runtime, s.runtime as shift_sum
  from {{ ref('work_unit_day_reports') }} d
  join (
    select work_unit_id, business_date, sum(runtime) as runtime
      from {{ ref('work_unit_shift_reports') }}
     group by 1, 2
  ) s using (work_unit_id, business_date)
 where d.runtime <> s.runtime
Run it on runtime and on availability_time at minimum. If those two agree, a systematic window error is very unlikely to be hiding in the rest.

15.7 month varchar(50) — please tell us the format
It is part of wu_month_report_key so you must write it, but its format is specified nowhere, and there is no CHECK constraint because guessing one would fail your first load. Nothing in mes-oee-monitor reads it — the By Monthly header formats its label from business_date instead.

Tell us what you intend (2026-08? August 2026? 2026-08-01?) and we will add the constraint. As it stands two DAG versions could disagree and both would load.

15.7b ideal_out is now load-bearing for the month report
The By Monthly screen draws an hour-of-day performance profile: 24 points, each collapsing every occurrence of that clock hour across the month. It reads oee.product_perf_wu_hour, and it depends on one column you already write.

ideal_out is GENERATED ALWAYS AS (ideal_rate_per_hour * runtime / 3600000). 0006's own comment calls it "THE load-bearing column" because it turns the non-additive master RATE into an additive QUANTITY — and the month profile is the first consumer that actually relies on that. The month's standard is recomputed as

sum(ideal_out) * 3600000 / sum(runtime) FILTER (WHERE ideal_rate_per_hour IS NOT NULL)
Two consequences for you.

Keep ideal_rate_per_hour NULL when no standard is known. Never COALESCE it to 0 and never substitute the actual rate. 0006 already says this; the month profile is where getting it wrong becomes invisible rather than obvious. A 0 makes ideal_out 0 and drags the month's standard down; the actual rate makes the loss vanish entirely.
The FILTER on that denominator is why partial coverage is safe. An hour with production but no standard still contributes its output and is excluded from the standard's weighting. If you ever compute a monthly standard yourself, divide by the runtime that carried a standard — not by all runtime. Dividing by all runtime understates the target, which SHRINKS performance loss, and nothing on the screen would look wrong.
actual_rate_per_hour is not read at any grain: the browser derives it from total_out and runtime, so the generated column is a convenience for BI rather than a dependency here.

15.8 What you need to do
Say now if any in-progress model writes availablity_loss_time (§15.1).
Build the day and month models, writing all seven new columns (§15.2), with business_date on the 07:00 → 07:00 boundary (§15.3).
Apply the additivity rules in §15.5. Read the seed script; it is the spec.
Add the cross-check test in §15.6 at error severity.
Backfill business_date and time_zone on work_unit_shift_reports (§3.1, §15.3).
Keep ideal_rate_per_hour NULL where no standard is known (§15.7b) — the month profile depends on it.
Write watermark rows for work_unit_day_reports and work_unit_month_reports. Both table names are already legal in ck_etl_watermarks_table and have been since 0005 — nothing writes them, so loadedThrough is null on every day and month payload and the screens cannot yet tell "no downtime" from "not loaded". §4 has the post-hook.
Tell us the month format (§15.7).
15.9 What is NOT asked of you
Nothing recalculates these two tables after an operator edits a downtime. §13 asks you to honour the operator override on downtime_reports only. The day and month tables roll up the same time, so a category edit makes them stale in exactly the way docs/downtime-edit-trd.md describes for the shift table — and as there, no rebuild is being requested here. It is recorded so it is known rather than discovered.

16. What 0014 adds — the LINE grain, and what it asks of you
This is the section to read first if you are picking up the work_center DAG, and it is a new DAG rather than a change to an existing one. Migration 0014 adds three tables:

oee.work_center_shift_reports     one line, one shift
oee.work_center_day_reports       one line, one business day
oee.work_center_month_reports     one line, one month
They carry the same ~30 measures as work_unit_shift_reports, rolled up across the machines on a line instead of across time. mes-oee-monitor reads all three — the Report › Line › {By Shift, By Day, By Monthly} screens — and they are empty, so those screens render an empty state until your models exist.

All three were created empty and are read by nothing else, which is the whole reason this section can ask for things §15 could not. Everything in §16.1 is free to change today and a coordinated deploy plus a backfill after your first load. Please answer §16.10 Q1–Q5 before you write a model.

16.1 Three deliberate divergences from work_unit_* — say now if any of them hurts
These tables are NOT a copy of the work_unit_* shape. Three differences are intentional, and each one drops a defect this document already records rather than reproducing it:

1. The upsert key is business_date, not a date instant. There is no date timestamptz column at all.

work_unit_*.date is the most-documented trap in this system: it holds the shift's START INSTANT, not a calendar day, so no calendar reading of it is correct without a time zone — see §3.1 and §15.3. It exists on those tables because it predates business_date and because it is half of their upsert keys. On a table that has never existed it has no reader: mes-oee-monitor filters and orders on business_date, and any window it resolves is business_date + time_zone computed in Postgres. Reproducing the column would have been re-planting a landmine for symmetry's sake.

2. month varchar(50) is nullable, OUT of the key, and now CONSTRAINED. §15.7 says of wu_month_report_key (date, month, work_unit_id) that the format of month "is specified nowhere" and that "two DAG versions could disagree and both would load". That is a uniqueness constraint over a string nobody defined. Here the column survives only as a label for BI — nothing in mes-oee-monitor reads it, the By Monthly header formats from business_date — and you have now specified the format, so it is enforced: ck_wc{s,d,m}r_month_format requires YYYY-MM (e.g. 2026-08) on all three tables. NULL remains legal, because the column is a convenience rather than a key. This is the difference the empty-table window buys: §15.7 could not add this constraint, and this one could.

3. business_date, time_zone and work_center_name are NOT NULL. On work_unit_* the first two are nullable because those tables already held rows and a DEFAULT would have fabricated a business day. That reason does not apply to an empty table, and the cost of leaving them nullable is stated in mes-oee-monitor's own filter code: a row whose business_date you have not written is invisible to any month or year filter while still appearing in an unfiltered list — so a filtered list comes back shorter than it should, with nothing to say why. NOT NULL moves that failure to your first load, loudly, where a re-run fixes it. work_center_name follows the rule 0008 set for work_unit_name: a Pareto whose rows cannot say which machine they came from is not one, and a Line list whose rows cannot say which line they are is not one either.

16.2 business_date means exactly what §15.3 says
The 07:00 → 07:00 plant-local business day, unchanged, including the DST worked example. A month row's business_date is the first business day of the month. Do not restate the arithmetic here — use §15.3, and note 0014 adds the CHECK that makes the month rule mechanical:

CHECK (business_date = date_trunc('month', business_date)::date)
16.3 The roll-up — §15.5's rules, plus three things that change at line grain
The rules are unchanged and are not negotiable:

Additive — SUM. Every *_time column, runtime, total_out, good_out, effective_out, reject, rework.
NOT additive — RECOMPUTE from the summed components, never average. oee, teep, availability, performance, quality, mttr, mtbf. There is no avg() in the reference implementation and there must never be one.
apps/api/scripts/seed/0015_work_center_reports_dev.sql derives all three tables from work_unit_shift_reports using exactly these rules. It is executable and you should read it as the specification, the way §15.5 asks you to read 0013's seed. Three things genuinely change when the group key is work_center_id rather than a time bucket:

(a) A line is MEASURED, not summed — line <> sum(machines). A line has its own count points, physically mounted on particular machines but read as the line's infeed and outfeed rather than as those machines' production. So availability_time on a four-machine line over an 8-hour shift is 8 hours, not 32, and TEEP's denominator is the line's calendar time, unscaled.

This is the correction to an earlier version of this section, which called the durations "machine-milliseconds" and asked you to assert line = sum(machines). That assumed a roll-up. It is not one, and five machines in series do not produce five times the output — they pass work along and the line ships what comes off the end. §16.8 now asks only for the invariant that is actually true.

One consequence for the roll-up rules above: they still apply, but along the TIME axis only. A line's day is the sum of its own line-shifts, and a month the sum of its days, with the rates recomputed from those sums. Nothing sums across machines.

(b) The unit is no longer invariant within a group. 0013's seed takes min(uom_id) and says of it: "they are denormalised labels that do not vary within a work unit; if they ever did, min() would pick one silently." Across the machines of a line they DO vary. min() here would label a mixed line BAG and sum cartons into the total. See §16.4.

(c) The NULL-skipping trap on the second hop, which is the subtle one. count(DISTINCT x) skips NULLs. So a day whose shift 1 was mixed-unit (uom_id NULL, counts NULL) and whose shifts 2 and 3 were BAG evaluates count(DISTINCT uom_id) = 1, writes BAG, and sum(total_out) then skips shift 1's NULL — producing a confident BAG label over a day that under-reports its output by a whole shift, with nothing failing anywhere. The gate needs both halves:

-- Both conditions are load-bearing:
--   count(DISTINCT uom_id) = 1  -> the members agreed on a unit
--   count(uom_id) = count(*)    -> and NO MEMBER ABSTAINED
CASE WHEN count(DISTINCT r.uom_id) = 1 AND count(r.uom_id) = count(*)
     THEN min(r.uom_id) END
One more that is easy to get wrong and invisible: work_unit_count is count(*) at the first hop and max() at the later ones. A day's machine count is its busiest shift's, not the sum of three shifts' counts.

16.4 A LINE HAS TWO UNITS — and the CHECKs that will FAIL YOUR LOAD
This section changed after you answered §16.10 Q2, and it is the one place the line grain differs in kind from the machine grain rather than merely in scope.

A discrete line consumes one thing and produces another — bags or calender rolls in, cartons or sacks out — and ms_code.count_points is what names which machine is which. So the tables carry two unit triples, not one:

Columns	Denominated in
total_out, reject, rework	infeed_uom_id / _name / _code
good_out, effective_out	output_uom_id / _name / _code
total_out = good_out + reject + rework IS THEREFORE FALSE AT THIS GRAIN, by construction rather than by defect. 100 bags in yielding 10 cartons out is not a 90% loss. Nothing in this schema computes across the two sides, and nothing on the shipped screens does either — the three Line list screens show OEE / Availability / Performance / Quality and no counts at all.

This is not a new idea in Gold. product_count_wu_shift already works this way: total_out, reject and rework are converted to the base unit while good_out stays in the production unit, and the SKU card carries a tooltip telling the reader the figures are not additive. The line grain makes the same split structural instead of documentary.

Within each side, NULL means "the members disagreed", not "unknown", and the counts are nulled WITH their label. 500 BAG + 12 CARTON = 512 <blank> is a wrong number with a missing label, not a smaller truth — the same treatment aggregateRejectReasons already gives a mixed bucket, where the unit and the converted figure go.

The two guards are separate, deliberately, so a line that knows what it consumed but not what it shipped keeps the half it is certain of:

CONSTRAINT ck_wcsr_infeed_units CHECK (
  infeed_uom_id IS NOT NULL
  OR (total_out IS NULL AND reject IS NULL AND rework IS NULL AND line_out IS NULL)
),
CONSTRAINT ck_wcsr_output_units CHECK (
  output_uom_id IS NOT NULL
  OR (good_out IS NULL AND effective_out IS NULL)
)
line_out joined the infeed CHECK in 0015. Widened rather than given a guard of its own, because it is denominated in exactly the unit that guard is about. If you are reading 0014 for the constraint text, this is the current form.

These can fail your load. That is the same call §14 (0011) made for the reason array shape, and for the same reason: the alternative renders as data.

Durations are unaffected. Time is time, which is why the list screens are well defined for a line whose two units differ — and why the dev seed can derive them while writing no units at all.

16.4a effective_out is on the OUTPUT side — settled
Confirmed by the pipeline owner: effective_out is denominated in the OUTPUT unit, alongside good_out. So the split is final:

Columns	Unit
total_out, reject, rework, line_out	infeed_uom_*
good_out, effective_out	output_uom_*
No schema change was needed — this is where 0014 already placed it — but the reading behind it is worth keeping, because two things follow that are not obvious from the DDL.

1. total_out and effective_out are now in different units at line grain. At machine grain they share one, which is why the Summary card can put "Actual Production" and "Effective Prod." next to each other without qualification. At line grain that stops being true, and anything comparing the two directly is comparing bags to cartons.

2. A future Line performance chart needs TWO Y axes, not one. apps/web/src/lib/perf-hourly.ts builds a single shared quantity domain over both series (domainOf(allPoints.flatMap((p) => [p.totalOut, p.effectiveOut]))) so that small multiples are directly comparable. That is correct for a machine and wrong for a line. Nothing is broken today — the chart is machine-only, and the Line detail screen that has since shipped deliberately does NOT include it for this reason.

And it cannot be fixed until you answer two things, which is why it is still recorded rather than done. A line performance chart needs product_perf_wu_hour rolled up by work_center_id, and it needs the line's TWO uom triples on those rows — otherwise the browser cannot know which series belongs to which axis. Neither exists. Designing the domain split against a payload nobody has specified would be guessing at the contract, so the note stays in perf-hourly.ts next to the domain it would break, and in TODOS.md §52.

What this does NOT change: the rates. Quality is time-derived (§16.10 Q3), so no OEE figure divides an output count by an infeed one, and no bags-per-carton conversion is needed anywhere in this schema.

16.4b line_out — a fourth count we need, added by 0015
What we are asking for: one more numeric(15,3) column on all three oee.work_center_*_reports tables, on the infeed side.

line_out  numeric(15,3)     -- nullable, no default
What it means: the line's own measured production at its infeed count point, denominated in infeed_uom_* — so it is comparable with total_out and with nothing on the output side. The Line detail screen's overview card labels this tile with the line's NAME ("Molca Line 8 Production"), beside total_out under "Total Production".

Why it is not derived. The obvious candidate was total_out - reject - rework. We are not doing that, and would rather you did not either: 0014 already records that a line is MEASURED, not summed, so an arithmetic identity between two count points is not something this schema asserts. If the line's infeed count point reports this figure directly, that is what we want.

What 0015 does and does not do:

It widens ck_*_infeed_units to cover line_out (see §16.4). A line_out written without an infeed_uom_id will FAIL YOUR LOAD, on the same terms as the other three infeed counts.
It does NOT assert total_out = line_out + reject + rework. A CHECK there would take a line's whole reporting down to protect one tile.
It adds no writer. The column ships NULL everywhere, and the tile renders an em dash until your DAG fills it — which is the correct state, not a bug to be worked around with a 0.
If this figure does not exist at your end, say so and we will remove the column and the tile rather than leave a permanently blank one on screen.

16.5 work_unit_count and expected_work_unit_count — write both
work_unit_count           NOT NULL   machines that REPORTED into this row  = count(*)
expected_work_unit_count  nullable   machines the line HAS, per master-data
If a line has four machines and one DAG partition fails, the row is written from three and renders a plausible, slightly-lower OEE with no signal anywhere. These two columns are what let the screen say "3 of 4" and let §16.8's test fail the load instead.

expected_work_unit_count is asked of you rather than resolved at read time deliberately: you already join mes-master-data to denormalise work_center_name, so the roster is in front of you. Resolving it in the API would mean one upstream HTTP call per line per page — an N+1 on a screen that otherwise touches nothing but Gold. Leave it NULL if you cannot supply it and the screen falls back to a bare count; it must never be a guess.

16.6 area_id / area_name, and the label-staleness policy
Both nullable, from mes-master-data, exactly as you already write product_perf_wu_hour.area_id. 0006's reasoning applies unchanged: the hierarchy above the work center is not reliably populated for every plant today, and NOT NULL here would block a first load.

Label staleness is accepted policy, and it is stated here so nobody is surprised by it. All of work_center_name, work_center_code and area_name are denormalised, so a line renamed in master-data keeps its old name on rows already written. Restate labels for rows inside your run window; do not backfill history. Old periods then carry the name the line had at the time, which is what a report should say, and it is already how work_unit_name behaves on every screen in the app. mes-oee-monitor makes no master-data call at all on this read path — the labels on the row are the only ones it has.

16.7 mttr / mtbf
Milliseconds, nullable with no default, and NULL rather than 0 for §15.4's reason verbatim: the screens render 0 as 00 s, a measurement, and NULL as an em dash, meaning "not computed". A DEFAULT 0 would make every unwritten row claim a perfect repair time. They are ratios, so they are recomputed from total repair time and total failure count across the line's machines — not averaged. Use the same definition of "failure" you use for the shift table.

16.8 One dbt test, at error severity
This section previously asked for two, and the first one was wrong. It asserted line_shift = sum(machine_shift), which assumed the line was a roll-up of its machines. It is not (§16.3a), so that test would have failed every load. It has been removed rather than softened.

What remains is the invariant that is true of a measured line, and it is the same one §15.6 asks for one axis over — a period equals the sum of the periods beneath it, for the same subject:

-- A line's day report equals the sum of its own line-shift reports.
-- (And a month, the sum of its days.)
select d.work_center_id, d.business_date, d.runtime, s.runtime as shift_sum
  from {{ ref('work_center_day_reports') }} d
  join (
    select work_center_id, business_date, sum(runtime) as runtime
      from {{ ref('work_center_shift_reports') }}
     group by 1, 2
  ) s using (work_center_id, business_date)
 where d.runtime <> s.runtime
Run it on runtime and on availability_time at minimum, and again for month-over-day.

What must NOT be tested: any agreement between a line row and the machine rows underneath it. There is no such relationship, and a test asserting one is a test that will be deleted later by somebody who has to work out why it fires.

16.9 Watermarks
0014 extends ck_etl_watermarks_table with the three new names. Without that your post-hook would fail on its first run — §4 is explicit that extending the list is a migration, which is the point. The post-hook itself is unchanged.

Note the three tables have no watermark rows yet, so loadedThrough is null for them and the screens cannot distinguish "this line did not run" from "not loaded" — the same gap §15 records for the day and month tables.

16.10 Questions — Q1 to Q5 ANSWERED, and what changed as a result
Answered by the pipeline owner before the migration merged, which is exactly the window §16 opened for. What each answer changed is recorded here so the reasoning survives the conversation.

Does a line row exist when only SOME of its machines reported? Can you supply expected_work_unit_count? — Yes and yes. Both columns stay as specified in §16.5.
What does a line's UOM mean, and do you model infeed and output units separately? — Separately, and they are usually different. "Discrete manufacturing lines utilise distinct input and output units… production volume, total production, rejects and rework rely on units associated with the INFEED machinery, whereas finished goods are measured using units from the OUTPUT machinery." This rewrote §16.4: one uom_* triple became infeed_uom_* and output_uom_*, with a separate CHECK per side. effective_out sits on the output side, confirmed separately — §16.4a.
Are the five rates time-derived or count-derived? — See §16.10a below; this one is still open, and it matters more now than when it was asked.
business_date as the upsert key rather than a date instant? — Yes, and it will be produced for the work unit, work centre and area grains (factory deferred). No change needed.
What format for month? — YYYY-MM (2026-08). Now enforced by ck_wc{s,d,m}r_month_format on all three tables (§16.1).
Every work unit has a work center — "even the process is batch or continuous line production." So the hierarchy is total: no machine is ever unattached, and expected_work_unit_count is always resolvable. This confirms the NOT NULL that has been on work_unit_shift_reports.work_center_id since 0003, and makes the dev seed's WHERE work_center_id IS NOT NULL guard belt-and-braces rather than load-bearing. Residual, and minor: what happens to rows ALREADY WRITTEN when a machine is re-parented to another line — restate them, or preserve the line it ran on at the time? Our position is preserve, because a report should say where the work happened. Nothing blocks on it.
Will the line models CHAIN from the machine reports, or be built independently? — Independently, from the line's own count points. This rewrote §16.3a, cut §16.8 down to a single test, and reframed the dev seed as a stand-in rather than a specification.
TEEP at line grain — the denominator is the line's own calendar time, unscaled, which follows from Q1/Q7. Flagged rather than asked: correct us if the line's calendar differs from its machines'.
Watermark rows for the three new tables (§16.9). Still open.
poc-flink-v2 is NOT the source. It is an older pipeline for a DIFFERENT project, and a new one is being written for mes-oee-monitor. §7's porting guidance is obsolete and is marked as such at the top of that section. Nothing should be ported from it — its line_shift_report in particular defines a line for another product's purposes.
16.10a Both settled — what changed, kept here so the reasoning survives
(a) A line is measured, not summed. Answered: "yes line have different count point. that is the table view that query from count point from the machine." A line's count points sit on machines but are read as the line's, so the line report is built from them rather than rolled up. Three things in mes-oee-monitor were written on the opposite assumption and are now corrected:

Was	Now
0014 called the durations "machine-milliseconds"	the line's own wall clock; line <> sum(machines) stated in the header and on every duration column
§16.8 asked for line_shift = sum(machine_shift) at error severity	removed — it would have failed every load. One test remains, day-over-shift (§16.8)
0015 presented itself as "the specification of the roll-up"	reframed as a dev stand-in. It still sums machines, because a dev database has nothing else to derive from, and now says at length that step 1 is invented and structurally wrong
(b) The rates are time-derived. Answered directly, and it closes the question §16.4 had reopened. For the record, since the distinction was asked about:

time-derived   quality = value_added_time / net_time     both durations, same unit
count-derived  quality = good_out / total_out            both counts
They agree only when the counts share a unit — and §16.4 establishes that at line grain they do not. A count-derived quality would have made a line taking 100 bags and shipping 10 cartons report "10% quality" with nothing rejected, and would have needed a bags-per-carton conversion this document does not name. Time-derived avoids all of it. The count columns are reported figures; no rate reads them.

16.11 What is NOT asked of you
No approval COLUMN, and there is nothing to key one on. oee.work_unit_shift_report_approvals is keyed (work_unit_id, date, shift) and these tables have no work_unit_id column at all, so nothing in this schema holds approval state and you are not asked to write any.

A line CAN now be approved from the Line detail screen, and it changes nothing here: the write closes the MACHINE shift reports on the line, in oee.work_unit_shift_report_approvals, and the line's own status is DERIVED by counting them. 0014's row-level write_audit triggers on these three tables are still the tripwire for "no operator mutation targets them" — if one of them ever fires, something has gone wrong. The list screens still carry no Status column at any grain.

No per-product rows. These tables do not answer the line-level SKU question; see the revised §7 for why the OEE half rolls up cleanly and the product half does not.

No recalculation after an operator's downtime edit. §15.9's position, unchanged and now one grain wider: a category edit makes these three stale too, and no rebuild is being requested. It is recorded so it is known rather than discovered.

No factory_id. Nothing in the product has a factory selector, and a nullable column added later to a table of any size is a metadata-only ALTER.

17. What 0016 adds — per-SKU output at the LINE grain
Two new tables, oee.product_count_wc_shift and oee.product_count_wc_day. They back the SKU View card on the Line report detail screens, which ships with an empty state until you fill them.

They are the same columns as oee.product_count_wu_{shift,day} — including uom_*, base_uom_* and factor_to_base unchanged — with work_unit_* replaced by work_center_* and shift_date / date replaced by business_date. If you already model the machine pair, this is that model keyed one level up.

17.1 THIS IS NOT A ROLL-UP OF THE MACHINE TABLES — please do not build it as one
This is the one thing to get right, and §16's own header is why. A line is measured, not summed: it has its own count points, so line <> sum(machines). You confirmed that, and 0014 records it.

oee.work_center_shift_reports.total_out is therefore the line's OWN measured output — and the Line detail screen renders it in a card directly above SKU View. So if these rows were a roll-up of product_count_wu_shift, the screen would show two sets of production figures that disagree, on one page, both correct. There is no caption that makes that readable.

What we need is the same count points, split by product. The line's infeed and outfeed counters already attribute output to a SKU; that attribution, per shift and per business day, is these tables.

17.2 The two units per row are the machine tables' rule, unchanged
total_out, reject, rework  ->  scaled by factor_to_base, denominated in base_uom_*
good_out                   ->  NOT scaled. Finish Good stays in uom_*.
This is §3.4's rule verbatim, and the browser already renders exactly this pairing with a tooltip saying the figures are not additive across it (apps/web/src/lib/product-count.ts). Nothing about it changes at line grain — which is why 0016 did not invent an infeed/output split the way 0014 had to for the report tables.

ck_pcwcs_factor admits any positive factor, exactly as ck_pcwus_factor does, so a wrong-but-positive value renders a plausible number rather than failing the load. We are asking for the same per-(product, uom, base_uom) consistency guarantee §3.4 asks for, for the same reason: nothing downstream can validate a factor's value.

17.3 Two tables, and the month grain is served by the day one
There is no product_count_wc_month, and none is wanted — the month screen reads the day table widened over an interval, exactly as the machine month screen already reads product_count_wu_day. One fewer model to keep consistent, and one fewer place for a sum to drift.

17.4 business_date, time_zone and work_center_name are NOT NULL
§15.3's meaning of business_date, and 0014's divergence 3: these tables are empty, so there is no populated-table excuse for nullable. A row whose business_date you have not written would be invisible to every window filter while still existing, which is a silently short card rather than a loud failure.

17.5 Watermarks
0016 adds product_count_wc_shift and product_count_wc_day to ck_etl_watermarks_table, so your post-hook can stamp them. Please do stamp them. The watermark is the only thing that lets SKU View say "product output has not been loaded for this line yet" instead of "this line produced nothing" — opposite claims about the same empty card, and until you write these tables the second one is a lie. TODOS.md §14 is the item that established that distinction after the machine card shipped making the flattering claim for both.

17.6 What is NOT asked of you
No per-machine breakdown inside these rows. The Machine View card on the same screen reads oee.work_unit_*_reports directly for that, which you already write.
No operator-entered reject or rework. These are your measurement; an operator's correction is a different fact. 0016's row-level write_audit triggers are the tripwire for that. THAT FEATURE IS NOW BUILT, and it kept the promise: it writes oee.work_center_quality_entries, its own table with its own audit trail, and §18 is the one change it asks of you. Nothing about these two tables changes.
No recalculation after an operator's downtime edit. §15.9 and §16.11's position, unchanged.
18. Operator-entered reject and rework — the second change you must make to your model
This is the second section that asks you to change a model you have already written, and like §13 it is not optional. Unlike §13, it does not describe a way your next run destroys somebody's work — it describes work that never arrives at all unless you do this.

mes-oee-monitor now ships an operator entry form on the Line report screens. An operator types in reject and rework the line's count points did not see — hand-sorted product, a QC hold, a batch pulled off the end — and each entry becomes one row in oee.work_center_quality_entries, a table this service owns and you have not seen before.

You read it. You never write it. Same standing as oee.downtime_report_history (§13) and the two approval tables (§12). It is deliberately absent from ck_etl_watermarks_table, so a dbt model of that name fails on its post-hook — if that ever happens, the model is pointed at a table it does not own and the fix is to delete the model, not to amend the constraint.

18.1 How this differs from §13, which changes the SQL
§13 is an override: it replaces four columns of a row you already build, keyed on source_event_id. This is an addition: there is no pipeline row for a manual reject to override, because no sensor recorded it. The operator is adding a fact, not correcting one.

Three consequences follow, and each is a different failure mode from §13's:

§13, downtime edit	§18, quality entry
operation	replace a column	add to a column
attaches to	an existing row (source_event_id)	a (line, business_date, shift) grain
if you get it wrong	the operator's edit is lost	the figure doubles, or the load aborts
precedence	operator wins	not applicable — nothing is being overridden
18.2 ONE JOIN, AT SHIFT GRAIN. Not three.
Every entry is a shift-grain fact, whichever screen produced it. The form is offered on the shift, day and month reports, but at month grain the operator picks a business date and a shift, and at day grain a shift — so all three land the same row shape, keyed (work_center_id, business_date, shift).

That matters because §16.3 already guarantees the rest: "A line's day is the sum of its own line-shifts, and a month the sum of its days." Fold the entries into the shift model and the day and month models inherit them through the roll-up you already perform.

Joining at day or month grain as well double counts — and §16.8's error-severity day-over-shift test will fire. That is the safety net working, but it fires on a load rather than in review, so: the one-join rule is not a preference. It is the only version that passes the test you already run.

Build the aggregate once, at shift grain, and re-aggregate it for the coarser models if they need it — never re-aggregate the source table three times, and never chain a coarse model off the already- overridden shift model and join the entries again.

18.3 The aggregate
-- The LIVE operator-entered quantities, at SHIFT grain, PER TARGET UNIT.
--
-- `voided_at IS NULL` is not optional: a corrected fat-finger stays in the table
-- as evidence, and counting it forever is the whole point of the column.
--
-- GROUPING BY target_uom_id is load-bearing, not tidiness. A sum across two units
-- is the "500 BAG + 12 CARTON = 512 <blank>" that §16.4 refuses. Each group is
-- denominated in exactly one unit, and the join below admits at most one of them.
WITH entry_shift AS (
  SELECT e.work_center_id,
         e.business_date,
         e.shift,
         e.target_uom_id,
         sum(e.target_qty) FILTER (WHERE e.kind = 'reject') AS reject_add,
         sum(e.target_qty) FILTER (WHERE e.kind = 'rework') AS rework_add
    FROM oee.work_center_quality_entries e
   WHERE e.voided_at IS NULL
   GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 4
)
target_qty is a generated column — the entered quantity converted into the line's unit, computed by the database from two snapshotted factors. It is the only figure you may sum. Do not recompute it from entered_qty, and do not use entered_qty directly: it is in whatever unit the operator typed.

18.4 The projection
SELECT s.*,   -- minus reject and rework; spell the columns however your dialect prefers

       CASE WHEN o.reject_add IS NULL THEN s.reject
            ELSE coalesce(s.reject, 0) + o.reject_add END   AS reject,
       CASE WHEN o.rework_add IS NULL THEN s.rework
            ELSE coalesce(s.rework, 0) + o.rework_add END   AS rework

  FROM base_work_center_shift s
  LEFT JOIN entry_shift o
    ON  o.work_center_id = s.work_center_id
    AND o.business_date  = s.business_date
    AND o.shift          = s.shift
    -- THE UNIT GATE. See §18.5 items 1 and 2 before touching this line.
    AND o.target_uom_id  = s.infeed_uom_id
coalesce(s.reject, 0) inside the ELSE is a narrow, deliberate decision. A report row with a known infeed unit but reject IS NULL means "not measured", and normally that must stay an em dash. But once an operator has entered a figure, "the only rejects anyone knows about are the 500 a human counted" is more informative than an em dash — so NULL degrades to 0 only in the presence of an entry, never otherwise.

18.5 Every way this join goes wrong
1. The unit predicate moved to WHERE. WHERE o.target_uom_id = s.infeed_uom_id after a LEFT JOIN silently converts it to an inner join and drops every line-shift with no operator entry — which is nearly all of them. The Line report goes from 900 rows to 12. It will be written that way at least once.

2. IS NOT DISTINCT FROM instead of =. This one aborts your load. It looks defensive and it is catastrophic. A mixed-unit shift has infeed_uom_id NULL, and ck_wcsr_infeed_units nulls reject and rework along with it — so matching that NULL and writing a non-NULL reject onto the row violates the constraint and fails the model, for one operator's entry against one mixed shift.

Plain = is self-protecting: target_uom_id is NOT NULL, NULL equals nothing, the entry matches nothing and contributes nothing. The predicate must be able to fail to match. Same for coalesce(s.infeed_uom_id, o.target_uom_id).

3. sum() over an empty FILTER is NULL, not 0. A shift with rework entries but no reject entries has reject_add = NULL, and s.reject + NULL is NULL — which wipes your own measured reject. This is the likeliest silent-data-loss bug in the section, because it only appears on shifts carrying one kind of entry and not the other. It is the same class as §13's CASE WHEN has_x versus COALESCE.

4. An UPDATE … SET reject = reject + x post-hook. It doubles on every run, forever, and nothing in the data says how many times it ran. The override must be part of the SELECT that builds the row — §13's whole architecture, and the reason it is stated there as a projection.

5. Applying it twice at one grain. If a coarse model is ever changed to build from the already overridden shift model and still joins the entries itself, they land twice. Rule: each model applies the override exactly once. If day ever chains from shift, delete its entry join in the same commit.

6. An incremental lookback shorter than an operator's memory. With a 3-day window, an entry made today against last Wednesday's shift is never applied — not late, never. The operator sees nothing happen and enters it again. Widen the incremental filter by the entry table:

{% if is_incremental() %}
WHERE s.business_date >= least(
        (current_date - interval '{{ var("lookback_days", 3) }} days')::date,
        coalesce((SELECT min(business_date)
                    FROM oee.work_center_quality_entries
                   WHERE greatest(entered_at, coalesce(voided_at, entered_at))
                         > coalesce((SELECT last_run_at FROM oee.etl_watermarks
                                      WHERE table_name = '{{ this.identifier }}'),
                                    '-infinity'::timestamptz)),
                 current_date))
{% endif %}
greatest(entered_at, voided_at) is what makes a void re-open its partition too. Without it, voiding a three-week-old entry leaves the inflated figure on the report permanently — the mirror of the same bug, and the easier one to miss.

7. Recording "this entry has been applied" anywhere. Do not. Keep the pipeline stateless with respect to this table. Idempotency comes from the projection being a pure function of (your base rows, the live entries); the moment you track application state, a re-run and a void disagree.

18.6 Two tests
Stranded entries — warn severity. Three ways an entry contributes to nothing: there is no report row for that (line, date, shift), the shift was mixed-unit, or the units disagree. All three are the join working as designed, and all three are invisible.

-- WARN, NOT ERROR. Each row here is a quantity a human counted that no figure
-- includes — worth surfacing, never worth blocking the whole Gold load for. That
-- is the mistake §16.8 made once and had to retract.
SELECT e.id, e.work_center_id, e.business_date, e.shift, e.kind,
       e.target_qty, e.target_uom_code, r.infeed_uom_code AS report_uom_code,
       CASE WHEN r.work_center_id IS NULL THEN 'no_report_row'
            WHEN r.infeed_uom_id  IS NULL THEN 'report_unit_null'
            ELSE                               'unit_mismatch' END AS why
  FROM oee.work_center_quality_entries e
  LEFT JOIN {{ ref('work_center_shift_reports') }} r
    ON  r.work_center_id = e.work_center_id
    AND r.business_date  = e.business_date
    AND r.shift          = e.shift
 WHERE e.voided_at IS NULL
   AND (r.work_center_id IS NULL OR r.infeed_uom_id IS DISTINCT FROM e.target_uom_id);
§16.8, widened — error severity. Its day-over-shift invariant runs on runtime and availability_time today. Once this lands, extend it to reject and rework. That is the only mechanical guard that all three grains got the same treatment: with entry_shift as the shared source, day = sum(shifts) holds exactly, because both sides sum the same rows.

18.7 What is NOT asked of you
No new rate arithmetic, and this is the important one. §16.10a(b) settled that the rates are time-derived. An entry moves reject and rework and nothing else — not quality, not oee, not teep, not quality_loss_time, not reject_time. Do not "fix" that by deriving a duration from a count, and do not adjust total_out or line_out to preserve an arithmetic identity: 0015 deliberately does not assert total_out = line_out + reject + rework, and this is one reason why.
Nothing at machine grain. An entry carries a work_unit_id, and it is provenance only — the machine the operator saw the rejects on. It must never influence oee.work_unit_*_reports. A line is measured at its own count points; that is why the quantity lands on the line.
No writes to the entry table, of any kind. No DELETE-then-INSERT, no truncate, no upsert, no backfill. It is append-only and its own trigger enforces that against you as well as against us.
No per-product attribution of the entry into oee.product_count_wc_*. §17.6's position, unchanged: an entry names a SKU so the conversion has a basis, not so it can be folded into your per-SKU measurement.
18.8 One question for you
Do you need SELECT granted explicitly? §6 proposes roles that do not exist yet and 0004 notes everything runs as superuser today, so there is nothing to do now. It is written down because the day least-privilege arrives, this is the read that silently returns zero rows and quietly stops applying every operator entry, with no error anywhere.

19. What 0018 adds — the LINE's hourly production, and one question
One new table, oee.product_perf_wc_hour. It backs the Performance Loss → Trendline sub-tab on the Line report's Losses page, which ships an empty state against it until you fill it — the same terms 0016 shipped on.

It is oee.product_perf_wu_hour keyed one level up, with work_unit_* replaced by work_center_* and 0014's two-unit rule applied. If you already model the machine table, this is that model at the line's own count points.

19.1 PLEASE DO NOT BUILD IT AS A ROLL-UP — and we told you the opposite once
product_perf_wu_hour already carries work_center_id NOT NULL with an index on (work_center_id, business_date), so grouping machine rows by line is trivially available, and an earlier version of our backlog said to do exactly that. That was wrong, and this section is the correction.

§16.10a(a) settled that a line is MEASURED, not summed: line <> sum(machines). So a machine-summed hourly curve would not integrate to the line's own shift and day totals — the same figures the overview card renders at the top of the very page the chart sits on. That is §17.1's argument one grain finer, and it is worse here: two numbers disagreeing can carry a footnote, but a CURVE whose area disagrees with the tile above it cannot be explained to a supervisor.

Same count points as product_count_wc_* (§17), one bucket finer.

19.2 THE ONE QUESTION: which side is ideal_rate_per_hour on?
We have assumed the OUTPUT side, and the CHECK constraint encodes that assumption. Please confirm or correct it before your first load.

ideal_out is the load-bearing generated column — it turns the non-additive master RATE into an additive QUANTITY, which is what makes sum(ideal_out) correct at any grain where avg(rate) is not (§3.5 works that arithmetic). Everything derived from it inherits its unit.

Output side (assumed). ideal_rate_per_hour is in output_uom_id per hour, ideal_out is output-denominated, and performance is effective_out / ideal_out — both output, so the ratio is unit-consistent.
Infeed side. Then every attainment figure divides an OUTPUT count by an INFEED target: cartons over bags. It produces a number between 0 and 1 that looks exactly like a percentage, and nothing downstream can detect it.
ck_ppwch_output_units refuses a standard with no output unit to express it in, so a row that disagrees with this assumption fails the load rather than loading a figure nobody can falsify. If your standards are genuinely infeed-denominated, say so and we will add a second pair of columns rather than reinterpret these.

19.3 The two units are 0014's rule, unchanged
Side	Columns
INFEED	total_out, reject, rework
OUTPUT	good_out, effective_out, ideal_out (and the standard above)
Both *_uom_id are nullable, and NULL means "the members disagreed", not "unknown" — with that side's counts NULL alongside it, enforced by ck_ppwch_infeed_units / ck_ppwch_output_units. §16.4's rule, and these can fail your load for the same reason.

A count with no unit is 500 BAG + 12 CARTON = 512 <blank>, and a chart is a worse place for that than a tile: an axis label is read once and a shape is read continuously.

19.4 Per product, and the key
(work_center_id, bucket_start, product_id), mirroring 0006. product_id is in the key because a changeover mid-hour is legitimate — one bucket, two products, two rows, each with its own runtime and its own standard.

shift is deliberately NOT in the key. (work_center_id, bucket_start) determines business_date, shift, hour_of_day and shift_hour_seq; those are denormalisations, not independent facts, so including shift would make "two rows for one bucket claiming different shifts" representable. 0006's reasoning verbatim.

bucket_start is an INSTANT. On a DST fall-back day the local hour 01:00 happens twice and those are two distinct buckets — §3.6 is still the highest-risk instruction in this document and it applies here unchanged.

19.5 Watermarks
0018 adds product_perf_wc_hour to ck_etl_watermarks_table. Write the post-hook row as §4 describes.

Note what is not there: work_center_quality_entries (§18) is deliberately absent, so a dbt model of that name fails on its post-hook. That is the tripwire, not an oversight.

19.6 What is NOT asked of you
No aggregate by hour at the shift, day or month grain. This service reads the buckets and aggregates them itself — 24 for a day, 24 hour-of-day buckets for a month, collapsed from ~720. §23's denominator rule applies: the month's rates are RECOMPUTED from ideal_out over the runtime that carried a standard, never averaged.
No backfill before you are ready. The screen says "not loaded yet" rather than drawing a flat line at zero, which is the same honest-empty trade 0008, 0009 and 0016 already made.
Nothing about operator entries. §18's reject and rework do not touch this table. They move reject and rework on the three report tables and no rate anywhere — see §18.7.
20. What 0019 adds — the LINE's rejects, and a table we should have asked for sooner
One new table, oee.reject_count_wc_shift. It backs the Quality Loss Pareto on the Line report's Losses page, which ships an empty state against it until you fill it.

It is oee.reject_count_wu_shift (§3.8) keyed one level up: work_unit_* replaced by work_center_*, and shift_date renamed business_date to match the rest of the work_center_* family (§16.1's divergence). If you already model the machine table, this is that model at the line's own count points.

20.1 WHY IT EXISTS — this is the third time, and the clearest
The Line screen's Quality Loss Pareto read your machine table, reject_count_wu_shift, scoped by work_center_id. That is a machine-sum, and §16.10a(a) settled that a line is MEASURED, not summed.

What makes this the sharpest instance is that the contradiction sits on one screen, two cards apart:

Card	Reads	Denominated in
Losses → Reject tile	work_center_shift_reports.reject	the line's own infeed count point
Quality Loss Pareto	(was) sum of the machines' counters	a different set of count points entirely
Those two disagree, the disagreement is correct, and nothing on the page can explain it. A supervisor reading "Reject 5,000 BAG" above a Pareto whose bars total something else has been handed two right answers to one question.

Your machine table is not wrong — it is the machines' rejects, and the machine report's own Pareto reads it correctly. What was wrong was pointing a LINE screen at it and changing only the WHERE clause. The WHERE changed the grain.

20.2 What is NOT being asked, and please do not "fix" it
The Others tab keeps reading oee.downtime_log_events at line scope, and that is correct. A reject and a stop are different kinds of fact:

a reject is a COUNT AT A COUNT POINT. The line has its own, so the machines' counters are a different measurement.
a stop is an EVENT IN TIME. A stop on a machine is a stop on the line. The union is the answer — which is why downtime has always been scoped by a query param at work unit, work center, area or factory.
There is no downtime_log_events_wc and there should not be one.

20.3 One table, widened — no day or month sibling
reject_count_wu_shift has no day or month table either; the coarse Paretos widen the shift table over a date range. Same here, for the reason §17.3 gives for stopping at two: a second table is a second thing to keep consistent for a read that a range already answers.

20.4 The columns, and the one that is deliberately absent
Everything §3.8 asks for, with work_unit_id, work_unit_name and work_unit_code removed.

That absence is the point of the file. These are the LINE's count points. If a reject can be attributed to a machine it belongs in reject_count_wu_shift, which already exists and which the machine report reads. A nullable work_unit_id here would invite exactly the roll-up this table replaces.

reason is a primary-key member and must be stable — §3.8's rule, unchanged: a renamed tag reads as a new counter and splits one shift's history in two.

converted_value is generated from counter_value * factor_to_base, as it is on the machine table, so a reader cannot drift from what a BI tool sees off the same row. It is the only figure the Pareto ranks on.

20.5 The unit rule, which bites harder here
The reader abstains when the rows in one bucket disagree on uom_code — it reports a NULL unit and the screen renders an em dash rather than summing unlike things. That is §16.4's rule reaching the Pareto.

It matters more at this grain than at the machine one, where a work unit has a single unit and the guard is near-decorative. A line's count points can genuinely differ, so please write uom_id / uom_code per row honestly rather than normalising them — the abstention is a better answer than a confident wrong total, and it only works if the rows tell the truth.

20.6 Watermarks
0019 adds reject_count_wc_shift to ck_etl_watermarks_table. Write the post-hook row as §4 describes — without it the Pareto cannot tell "not loaded yet" from "this line rejected nothing", which are opposite claims about an identical empty response (§14).

20.7 A question, and an apology for the ordering
Do your line count points record a reason at all? §3.8's reason is a PLC counter tag (Total_NG_Prod, NG_Over_Count) and this table assumes the line's equivalent exists. If a line's reject counters are unlabelled, say so — the table would then need a single synthetic bucket rather than a NOT NULL key member, and that is better decided now than discovered on a first load.

This should have been asked alongside §17, when the same argument produced product_count_wc_*. It was not, and a Line screen shipped reading the machine table in the meantime.

21. What 0020 adds — SKU attribution for downtime — ANSWERED 2026-09-02
THE PIPELINE OWNER'S ANSWERS. Recorded here rather than summarised, because two of them change what the application may assume.

Q1 — attribution rule: THE SKU RUNNING WHEN THE STOP STARTS. Chosen from the three offered; the other two are not implemented and should not be assumed anywhere.

Q1 also brought an unasked-for fact that is more consequential than the answer. Apache Flink detects downtime on the stream, and its procedure is:

nothing produced for 1 minute → write a stop to Silver as SMALL_STOP;
past 5 minutes → UPSERT, promoting category to PLANNED / UNPLANNED;
production resumes → UPSERT end_at and duration;
nothing produced through to the end of the shift → UPSERT, forcing end_at and duration TO THE SHIFT BOUNDARY.
Step 4 is a guarantee this document did not previously have: NO STOP CROSSES A SHIFT OR A DAY. It is deliberate — the owner's stated purpose is exactly that. See §21.7 for what it does and does not license.

Q2 — yes, the SKU is known at detection time, but Silver records the product's EXTERNAL CODE. Resolving it to a real product_id / product_name requires joining ms_core.product_code_alias on that external code. That join is the pipeline's; this service never sees an external code.

Q3 — product_id and product_name will always be written together, and data consistency in Gold is guaranteed by the loader. So 0020's decision not to add a pairing CHECK stands on the owner's word rather than on hope.

product_code was not requested, so 0020's two columns stay two.

The index question (§21.6) is deferred to the backlog at the owner's request — TODOS.md §72.

21.7 What the shift-bounded guarantee does NOT license
Flink forcing end_at to the shift boundary means a straddling stop should not exist in Silver, and therefore should not reach Gold. This service is not removing its straddle handling, and that is not distrust.

clipToWindow, the two-shift freeze in listApprovalsOverlapping, and the half-open overlap test all stay. They are the difference between a wrong number and a right one IF the guarantee ever lapses — a Flink restart mid-shift, a backfill written by something other than Flink, a shift-calendar change applied to one system before the other.
An open stop still exists: end_at IS NULL for the whole of a stop in the currently-running shift. Everything that reads coalesce(end_at, ...) is still live.
What it DOES license is expectations: a stop spanning two business days is now a data-quality signal, not a normal case, and it is worth alerting on rather than silently clipping.
If step 4 ever changes, tell us before it ships. It is the kind of change that alters numbers rather than breaking a query.

Two columns, product_id and product_name, on both downtime tables: oee.downtime_reports and oee.downtime_log_events. Both are nullable and every existing row has them NULL, which is the honest state until you write them.

They exist for the SKU/Product daily report (TODOS.md §65), which is "one SKU, on one line, on one business date". Everything on that screen that counts — Finish Good, Effective Prod, Runtime, Performance, the Quality Pareto — is already answerable from tables you have or have been asked for (product_count_wc_day §17, product_perf_wc_hour §19, reject_count_wc_shift §20). Everything on it that involves time — Availability, therefore OEE, the timeline, the waterfall, the Losses durations, the downtime table — is not, because no row anywhere in Gold says which SKU was running when a line stopped.

21.1 WHY THIS IS A COLUMN AND NOT A NEW TABLE
§16.10a(a), §17.1, §19 and §20 all reached the same answer — a line is MEASURED, not summed, so it gets its own table. This one deliberately does not, and the difference is worth stating because it looks like the same question.

Those four were about a count at a count point: the line has its own counter, so its number is a measurement and cannot be reconstructed from its machines'. A stop is not a count, it is an event in time, and §20 already recorded the consequence — a stop on a machine genuinely IS a stop on the line, which is why downtime is scoped by query param at every level of the hierarchy and why the Others tab was explicitly not "fixed" to match the reject tables.

SKU is a third kind of axis and neither rule covers it. The hierarchy axis is containment — a work unit is inside a work center, permanently. SKU is occupancy over time: the line runs A, then B. A stop while A was running is not a stop on B, and no scope parameter can derive that, because the fact is not in the row. So: a column, on the rows you already write, not a fifth aggregate.

21.2 It is a FILTER, not a scope
SCOPE_COLUMN in this service maps work-unit and work-center and refuses area and factory. product is never a member of that enum. A SKU read is always a scope plus a product predicate — "this SKU, on this line" — because a SKU across the whole plant is a different question nobody has asked for.

Nothing changes for you here; it is recorded so a future scope=product request is recognised as a different design rather than a missing case.

21.3 THE UNIQUE KEY FORCES THE ATTRIBUTION RULE — please confirm which one you pick
oee.downtime_reports.source_event_id is UNIQUE (§3.7, added by 0007). It is the idempotency key and the eventual ON CONFLICT target. A stop is one row, permanently.

So a stop that straddles a changeover — starts under SKU A, ends under SKU B — must not be split into two rows. Two rows would carry the same source_event_id and the second INSERT fails the unique index; giving one of them a NULL source_event_id to dodge that resurrects the duplicate-on-retry bug 0007 exists to close.

Q1. Which rule do you apply? Any of these is workable and we do not have a preference, but we need to know which, because it changes what the number means:

the SKU running at start_at, or
the SKU that occupied the majority of the stop's duration, or
NULL whenever the stop is not wholly inside one SKU's run.
Q2. Is the SKU knowable at all from Silver at the moment a stop is recorded? If it is only derivable by joining a stop's window against a production run elsewhere, say so — that is a legitimate answer and it tells us these columns will be sparse rather than mostly-populated, which changes what the screen must say.

21.4 NULL means "not attributed", never "no product"
Two consequences, and the second is the one that produces a wrong number quietly.

A SKU-scoped read filtering product_id = X excludes every unattributed stop. Until you write the column that is every stop, so a SKU report would read Availability 100% with an empty downtime table — a plausible screen, not an error. This service will distinguish "no stops" from "no attribution" the way §8 and §14 already distinguish the ETL-not-loaded case; that is our half.
Per-SKU downtime does not sum to the line's downtime while any row is unattributed, and the residual is invisible on a per-SKU screen. This is the "measured, not summed" rule arriving from the other direction: there, summing children contradicted a measured parent; here, summing the attributed rows understates the parent by exactly the unattributed remainder.
product_name is denormalised and nullable, matching work_unit_name, work_center_name and area_name on the same table. 0020 deliberately adds no (product_id IS NULL) = (product_name IS NULL) check, because those three older columns keep no such rule and a guard on product alone would be a constraint nobody agreed to. Q3: please keep them written together anyway — an id with no name renders a bare integer to a supervisor.

product_code was not added, unlike product_count_wc_* (§17) and reject_count_wc_shift (§20) which both carry it. If you would rather write the same triple everywhere, say so and it is one more ALTER TABLE.

21.5 The two tables must agree
downtime_log_events (§3.9) gets the columns too. It has no duration and no instant — you assign each event to exactly one (work_unit_id, shift_date, shift) and the contribution is 1 — and a SKU changes none of that. It adds one thing to decide at assignment time, and it must be decided the same way as for downtime_reports: the two are read side by side on one Losses page, so the same real stop attributed to two different SKUs would put the Others tab and the Availability Pareto in visible disagreement on one screen.

21.6 No index yet, and why we are telling you
0020 adds no index on either column. At the row counts we can see, one would be built over a column that is 100% NULL, and 0007 declined an index on the same table for the same reason. When your load lands, the likely answer is a second GiST index leading with product_id, not a change to dt_reports_span_gist — whose expression every query must repeat character for character, so altering it silently unindexes the existing callers. If you expect these columns to be dense, tell us and we will measure before the first big load rather than after.

22. What 0021 adds — a real business date on downtime — ANSWERED 2026-09-02
ALL THREE ACCEPTED. business_date + time_zone will be written (Q1), date keeps being written until we say otherwise (Q2), and the backfill will be a real derivation rather than a cast (Q3).

Q2 came back with an offer we should take: DROP date NOW. The owner's reasoning is that the pipeline is still being designed, no data has landed, and this is a development server — so the cost of carrying two columns meaning the same thing is higher than the cost of removing one. Explicitly: "jika kamu berinisiatif untuk menghapus kolom tersebut kamu bisa melakukannya sesegera mungkin." TODOS.md §71 carries it. §69 removed the last read-path reader of date on 2026-09-02, so nothing in this service is waiting on it.

Q3 carried the most important thing in either answer, and it is not about dates. See §23 — the schema's purpose and its intended consumers.

Two columns on oee.downtime_reports: business_date date and time_zone varchar(64). Both nullable, both NULL on every existing row.

oee.downtime_log_events needs nothing — it already carries shift_date date NOT NULL and time_zone varchar(64) NOT NULL from §3.9. This section is about the older table only.

22.1 The problem
oee.downtime_reports.date is timestamp with time zone, and the value in it is a business day. The type says instant; the meaning is a day. There is no COMMENT on the column and the only place that semantics is written down is a source comment in this service.

That is survivable while one service reads it and unsurvivable the moment a second one does, which §21's SKU work makes imminent — a SKU report is keyed on a business date, and joining a date-typed-as-timestamptz against a real date column is a silent off-by-one rather than a type error.

22.2 THE ONE THING WE NEED YOU TO NOT DO
Do not backfill business_date with date::date.

timestamptz::date resolves through the session's TimeZone. For any plant WEST of whatever zone the session happens to be in, an instant at or near local midnight truncates to the previous day. Every boundary stop moves one day, every window that should contain it stops containing it, and nothing raises.

Measured against postgres:18-alpine rather than reasoned about — one instant, local midnight in a UTC+7 plant, cast under two sessions:

SET TimeZone='UTC';           ('2026-09-02 00:00:00+07')::date  ->  2026-09-01
SET TimeZone='Asia/Jakarta';  ('2026-09-02 00:00:00+07')::date  ->  2026-09-02
The container's default is UTC and our migrator sets no TimeZone, so the naive backfill takes the first branch on every boundary row.

We did not write the backfill into 0021 for this reason, and we cannot write it correctly from here: only the writer knows which zone the day was cut in. That is why time_zone arrives in the same migration rather than later — a business day with no zone cannot be turned back into an instant range, which is the same pairing §15 made for the machine reports.

22.3 What we are asking for
Q1. Write business_date as the plant-local calendar day the stop is attributed to, and time_zone as the IANA zone that day was cut in — the same pair, and the same rule, as downtime_log_events.shift_date / time_zone already uses. If a stop's attribution rule differs between the two tables, say so; they are read on one screen.
Q2. Keep writing date as well, unchanged, until we tell you otherwise. It is still NOT NULL and it is still what our overlap queries narrow on. We retire it on our side in a later change (TODOS.md §69) and will confirm here before asking you to stop.
Q3. For rows already loaded, a re-derivation from the source event's own local timestamp is correct; a cast of date is not, per §22.2. If the source no longer has that, tell us — a partial backfill with honest NULLs is better than a complete one that is a day out on the boundary rows, and our reads already distinguish "not loaded" from "nothing happened" (§8, §14).
22.4 A naming inconsistency we are choosing to keep
business_date here, shift_date on downtime_log_events. Both are the same concept, and the split already exists across the schema: the work_unit_* family says shift_date (§3.8, §3.9) and everything added since 0013 says business_date (§15, §16.1, §17, §20).

We are not renaming shift_date. It is NOT NULL, you may already be writing it, and a rename is a breaking change bought for tidiness. New tables get business_date; the two older ones keep their names. Flagging it so it reads as a decision rather than as drift when you meet both in one model.

23. What this schema is FOR — stated by its owner, 2026-09-02
Recorded because every table-shaped decision in this document has been argued locally, and this is the first statement of what the whole is supposed to become. It is the tiebreaker for the next "should this be its own table?" question.

23.1 The priority is a GOOD SCHEMA, not more tables
"yang harus diprioritaskan sekarang adalah bentuk skema database gold yang baik. Tidak over table report, sesuai dengan functional requirement itu yang paling wajib."

Do not over-table. Match the functional requirement and stop. This is a direct counterweight to the reasoning in §16.10a, §17.1, §19 and §20, each of which answered "measured, not summed" with a new table — correctly, but the pattern is not a licence. It is also why 0020 attributed downtime to a SKU with two columns rather than a seventh report table: the cheaper shape was the right one, and this section is the reason to keep preferring it.

23.2 The intended surface, which is larger than what exists
Reports, for the application, at every combination of:

Subject	shift	day	month	year
work unit	shipped	shipped	shipped	shipped
work center (line)	shipped	shipped	shipped	shipped
SKU	—	shipped	—	—
area	—	shipped	shipped	shipped
factory	—	—	—	required
The status column is kept current as tables land; the prose below is the owner's statement of intent and is left as written. SKU shipped as 0023 (§24); area's day grain as 0024 (§25) and its month grain as 0025 (§26) — a separate table, because a month's rates cannot be got by widening a day's. Area is TWO grains rather than three, deliberately: the requirement is explicit that it "only have 2 type of report on the Area", which makes it the first subject where the {shift, day, month} triple is broken by decision rather than by absence. The year grain then broke that triple a second time and in the opposite direction: 0027 added it for work unit, work center and area, which is MORE than this table asked for — §27.1 states that widening rather than leaving it to be discovered. Only FACTORY is left, and it is still the subject with no table at any grain.

Then a second surface on top of the same data: an OEE Performance dashboard for work unit, work center, area and factory.

Two things follow that are worth saying now. Factory is the only subject that needs a YEAR grain, and nothing in this schema has a year grain yet — the {shift, day, month} triple has been assumed universal and it is not. And area and factory have no report table at all, which is the same gap TODOS.md §15 hit from the SKU side and could not answer.

23.3 Gold is meant to be read by people outside this application
"harapan kami juga besar agar tabel tabel dan data data yang sudah ada dapat dikonsumsi oleh pihak external agar bisa dianalisa."

Third parties should be able to point their own BI tooling at these tables and build the analytics this application does not provide.

This raises the bar on things that have so far been treated as internal conveniences, and it is the strongest argument yet for several open items:

Column names and semantics are a public interface. date meaning a business day while typed timestamptz (§22) is exactly the trap an external analyst cannot be warned about — they have no shift-window.ts to read. The shift_date / business_date split (§22.4) is the same hazard, milder.
Documented meaning has to live in the database, since a reader outside this repo sees only COMMENT ON COLUMN. 0020 and 0021 both comment every column they add; older tables are patchier.
The unit rules become load-bearing for strangers. §16.4a's two-unit split — total_out = good_out + reject + rework being FALSE at the line grain — is correct, deliberate, and the single most likely thing an external analyst gets wrong. It needs to be discoverable from the schema, not just from here.
23.4 Before production
The owner will add migration, rollback and data-migration documentation to this contract once the application is live, so that changes are made with more care than a development server warrants. Until then, destructive changes on an empty development database are cheap and are the right time to make them — §71 is the first of those, offered rather than requested.

24. What 0023 adds — the SKU grain, and the one thing you must not do to it
One table, oee.product_report_wc_day. One SKU, on one line, on one business day. It ships EMPTY and backs the SKU/Product daily report, which is the third of the five report subjects §23.2 lists.

Day grain only. No shift table and no month table — a month is this table widened over an interval, exactly as product_count_wc_day serves the line's month screen.

24.1 THE RULE: MEASURED PER SKU, NEVER APPORTIONED FROM THE LINE
This is the same sentence §16.10a, §17.1, §19 and §20 each needed, one grain further down, and it is the only thing in this section we cannot recover from if it is got wrong.

line <> sum(SKUs). A line's availability is its own wall clock. It cannot be divided between the products that shared the day, because the stops did not divide — a changeover belongs to the changeover, not to 40% of SKU A and 60% of SKU B.

The tempting shape, and the one we are asking you not to build:

-- DO NOT DO THIS
SELECT r.availability,                          -- the LINE's, copied down
       r.availability_loss_time * (p.good_out / sum(p.good_out) OVER ()) -- apportioned
It produces a table where every SKU on a line reports the same availability, and loss durations that sum neatly to the line's. Both properties look like correctness and are the opposite: they are the roll-up this table exists to deny, and a supervisor comparing two SKUs on one line would find them identical for a reason no screen could explain.

If a SKU's own availability is not measurable from your sources, write NULL. The screen renders an em dash. A wrong number does not.

24.2 The key, and why there are two of them
id integer GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY is the primary key, and UNIQUE (work_center_id, business_date, product_id) sits beside it.

Please load this table with an UPSERT on the natural key, not DELETE-then-INSERT. The browser puts id in URLs and cache keys, as it does for all six existing report tables, so a churning id silently retargets a deep link at a different SKU. 0007's header records that hazard on downtime_reports.id, where there was no natural key to upsert on until source_event_id existed. There is one here from the first migration.

INSERT INTO oee.product_report_wc_day (...) VALUES (...)
ON CONFLICT (work_center_id, business_date, product_id) DO UPDATE SET ...
24.3 What is deliberately absent
No teep. TEEP divides by CALENDAR time, and a SKU does not own the calendar — the line does, and shares it. oee stays, because it divides by the SKU's own loading time.
No work_unit_count. A SKU ran on one line; work_center_id is NOT NULL and single-valued.
No per-machine rows. §15's base-unit conversion problem is unchanged.
24.4 The two units, and one difference from 0014 worth reading
Same infeed/output split, same CHECK pair nulling a side's counts with its unit, same consequence: total_out = good_out + reject + rework is FALSE here (§16.4a).

One word differs. On a work_center_* row, a NULL unit means "the members disagreed". Here there are no members — one SKU, one line — so NULL means simply "not known". That makes it rarer and more suspicious: at the line grain a NULL unit is a normal outcome, here it is a data-quality signal.

time_zone is NOT NULL, unlike on downtime_reports where 0021 had to admit existing rows. This table is empty, so the pairing can be enforced from the start.

24.5 The watermark
product_report_wc_day is now in ck_etl_watermarks_table. Please write the row. Without it the screen cannot tell "this SKU had no production that day" from "the DAG has not run", which is the distinction §8 and §14 both exist for and the one thing an empty report cannot say for itself.

24.6 Questions
Q1. Can you measure a SKU's own availability at all? If loading time and downtime are only attributable to the LINE, say so — the honest answer changes the screen (the OEE tiles render em dashes and the Losses card leans on §21's downtime attribution instead) and is much better than an apportioned figure.
Q2. Does 0020's downtime product_id come from the same attribution you would use here? They are read on one screen: the Losses card sums this table's availability_loss_time, and the downtime table beneath it lists stops filtered by product_id. If the two rules differ, those two disagree and neither is wrong.
Q3. Is a SKU that ran for ten minutes a row? We would rather have it with tiny durations than not have it — a missing row reads as "did not run", and §14's argument applies. But if you plan a floor, tell us the threshold so the screen can say so.
25. What 0024 adds — the AREA grain, and the two things about it that invert 0014
One table, oee.area_day_reports. One area, on one business day. It backs the Report > Area > By Day screens and it ships EMPTY.

TODOS.md §74 said not to start by writing tables and asked the prior question first: which of the remaining subjects is a MEASUREMENT with its own count points, and which is a legitimate roll-up. That question is answered here, and the answer is not the one the last four migrations gave — so please read §25.1 before anything else.

25.1 A LINE IS MEASURED. AN AREA IS COMPOSED.
0014 exists because a line has its own count points: an infeed counter and an output counter, physically on the line, so line <> sum(machines) is not a defect and a roll-up would have contradicted the line's own instruments. §17.1, §19.1 and §20.1 each repeat that argument one axis over. §24.1 repeats it for SKU.

An area has no instrument. There is no counter at the edge of an area and no clock that an area runs on; an area is a set of lines that happen to be managed together. So every figure on this row is a COMPOSITION of its member lines' figures, and two consequences follow that no other report table in this schema has to deal with.

25.2 THE DURATIONS ARE LINE-MILLISECONDS, NOT WALL-CLOCK MILLISECONDS
0014's header is explicit that a line's durations are "the line's own wall clock — 8 hours over a 4-machine shift, not 32", and an earlier reading of it that called them "machine-milliseconds" was CORRECTED. At this grain that corrected reading is the right one. availability_time for a five-line area on one business day is ~120 hours, not ~24.

It has to be, or the loss durations could not add: an area that lost 3 h on line A and 2 h on line B has lost 5 h of production capacity, and there is no "wall clock" reading under which that is anything else.

So runtime on this table WILL exceed 24 hours on a normal day. The Run Time tile is expected to read "97 h 12 m" and carries a tooltip saying so. Please do not divide by the line count. The COMMENT ON COLUMN says this in the database too, because an external reader has no source file (§23.3).

25.3 THE COUNTS ARE A MASS, AND THAT IS WHY THERE IS ONLY ONE UNIT
0014 gives a line TWO unit triples because bags go in and cartons come out. An area's members disagree about BOTH sides — one line ships cartons, another sacks — so 0014's shape applied here would leave both triples NULL on almost every row and null every count with them. The Total Production tile would be a permanent em dash.

Weight is the answer, and it is the requirement's answer:

"{Area} Production, Total Production, and Finish Good use Weight Unit. Every sku packageing have weight, min weight, max weight value."

Every product package in ms_product.product_packaging carries std_weight / min_weight / max_weight, so a count in ANY packaging unit converts to a mass. Mass is the only unit that survives composition across an area, which is exactly why an area has one unit where a line has two. The 0014 rule is not being relaxed; it is being satisfied by picking a unit the members can all be expressed in.

What we need from you: weight_uom_* and the five counts, converted through std_weight. Three things about that conversion:

NULL when you cannot do it. If a product that ran in the window has no std_weight, write NULL for the unit and NULL for all five counts — ck_adr_weight_units requires the pairing. That is a data-quality signal pointing at master data, and it is much better than a mass computed from a guessed weight. Note this is a THIRD meaning for a NULL unit in this schema: on a LINE row it means the members disagreed, on a 0023 SKU row it means simply not known, and here it means the members could not be brought to a common mass.
Please tell us which weight you use — std_weight, or something derived from the min/max band. We assumed std_weight and the screen says nothing about it; if it is actually a measured average, that is worth naming on the tile.
total_out = good_out + reject + rework IS STILL NOT ASSERTED. At line grain it is FALSE because the two sides are in different units (§16.4a). Here the units agree, so the sum is at least well-formed — and it is still not an identity, because the five figures come from different count points on N lines and mass is neither conserved through a packing line nor measured at a single point. No CHECK asserts it, for 0015's reason: a CHECK that failed a load over an arithmetic disagreement between count points would take a whole area's reporting down to protect a tile.
25.4 The roll-up rules, which are §15.5's with one addition
durations and counts                    ->  SUM (in LINE-milliseconds; §25.2)
rates (oee, availability, performance,
       quality, mttr, mtbf)             ->  RECOMPUTE from the sums
Never avg(availability). §15.5 works the arithmetic on the analogous case; a mean of ratios is not the ratio of the sums, and it is the sums this row holds.

The addition is area_name / area_code / factory_id / factory_name. The first is NOT NULL; the other three are nullable and denormalised, exactly as 0014 denormalises the level above a line. factory_* is not read by this application at all yet — it is here so the factory report (§23.2) is a read rather than a hierarchy lookup, and so an external analyst can group areas without joining out to master data. The label-staleness policy is §16.6's, unchanged.

apps/api/scripts/seed/0022_area_day_reports_dev.sql is the executable form of this section, and unlike 0015's seed it is normative rather than a stand-in — because an area is composed, summing its lines IS the definition. The one thing it cannot do is the mass conversion, so it writes NULL for the unit and the counts and asserts that it did.

25.5 Which lines belong to an area, and the one column that is missing
Five of the six reads behind these screens scope by a plain area_id predicate, because five source tables already carry the column:

table	area_id	added by
oee.area_day_reports	IS the key	0024
oee.work_center_day_reports	yes, nullable	0014
oee.reject_count_wc_shift	yes, nullable	0019
oee.downtime_log_events	yes, nullable	0009
oee.downtime_reports	yes, nullable	0007
oee.product_count_wc_day	NO	—
The last row is the SKU View's only source, so that one read resolves the area's LINES first — from oee.work_center_day_reports.area_id over the same window, which is your own attribution rather than a master-data roster. It works, and it is one round trip we would rather not make.

A small ask, entirely optional: area_id / area_name on oee.product_count_wc_{shift,day}, denormalised the way 0019 and 0009 already carry it. Same for oee.work_center_quality_entries, where the activity feed currently fans out one query per line. Neither blocks anything.

And one thing to know about the nullable ones. A stop or a count row the pipeline never attributed to an area is EXCLUDED from that area's totals, silently. That is denormalisation lag rather than a semantic gap — containment means the area IS derivable from work_unit_id, so the row is simply missing a label it could have — which is why none of these reads ships an "unattributed" count the way the SKU downtime reads do (§21.4). If the column turns out to be sparse in production, the fix is a backfill, and we would want to know rather than discover it as a low OEE.

25.6 What is deliberately NOT asked of you
No shift table. The requirement is day and month only.
No month table in 0024. It is a separate migration and a separate deliverable — a month's rates cannot be got by widening a day's, which is why oee.work_center_month_reports exists beside the day one. It will be 0025.
No teep. TEEP divides by CALENDAR time, and an area owns no calendar a reader could name — is it 24 hours, or 24 times the line count? §25.2 makes the second of every other duration here, and a ratio over that denominator is one nobody has asked for. oee stays: it divides by the area's own composed loading time.
No effective_out. The requirement's Area Overview names OEE, A, P, Q, Achievement, {Area} Production, Total Production, Finish Good and Runtime, and stops. §23.1 — match the requirement and stop.
No member count. No work_center_count. The requirement's list and overview name none. This is the field most likely to be asked for next, and it is an ALTER TABLE when it is; say if you would rather write it now than add it later.
No per-unit table. The requirement also asks for production summed across every unit the area's lines count in, which is the half a mass cannot answer. That is a read-time aggregate over oee.work_center_day_reports grouped by its own two unit triples — exact addition within a unit, with no denominator to invent — so §23.1 applies and there is nothing here for you to load.
No area hourly table. The Performance Loss Trendline renders an empty state at this grain. An area-summed curve off oee.product_perf_wc_hour would be the roll-up §19.1 refuses; if an area-level hourly view is ever wanted it needs its own measured source, and that is a conversation rather than a column.
25.7 The watermark
area_day_reports is now in ck_etl_watermarks_table. Please write the row. Without it the screens cannot tell "this area had no production that day" from "the DAG has not run" — §8 and §14's distinction, and the state this table ships in.

Note the Input/Output Production card reads work_center_day_reports' watermark instead, because that is the table its rows are summed from. Two different loads, and quoting the wrong one would vouch for a freshness the card's own source does not have.

25.8 Questions
Q1. Which weight do you use, and per what? §25.3. We assumed product_packaging.std_weight for the package the count was taken in. If it is a measured average or a min/max midpoint, the tile should say so.
Q2. Is an area with one line a row? It is numerically identical to that line, which makes the screen look redundant but is not wrong. We would rather have it.
Q3. Should area_id be backfilled on the four nullable tables, and by when? §25.5. Everything works without it and reports a subset of the plant when it is missing, which is the failure mode we would least like to find in production.
Q4. Do you want the member count now? §25.6. One column, and it would stop the next requirement being an ALTER TABLE.
26. What 0025 adds — the AREA's month, and why it is not the day table widened
One table, oee.area_month_reports. One area, one month. It backs the Report > Area > By Monthly screens and it ships EMPTY.

§25 is the file to read first. Everything that makes an area's numbers different from a line's is argued there and is unchanged here: an area is COMPOSED rather than measured, its durations are LINE-milliseconds, its counts are a MASS in one unit, and total_out = good_out + reject + rework is not asserted. This section is 0024 plus one CHECK and one argument.

26.1 Why a second table, when §17.3 chose the other way
This is the question 0016 answered in the opposite direction — it created two product-count tables rather than three, "because a day table serves month by widening, which listPeriodProductCount already proves". That reasoning is right for a COUNT table and wrong for a REPORT table, and §15.5 is the difference:

durations and counts   ->  SUM        widening a day range gives this
rates (oee, a, p, q)   ->  RECOMPUTE  widening a day range does NOT
A month's OEE is not the average of its days' OEEs, and it is not derivable from the day rows without redoing the recompute in the reader — which would put a SECOND definition of area OEE in the API, one click from the day screens it drills into. That is the failure 0023 and 0024 both exist to prevent. oee.work_unit_month_reports and oee.work_center_month_reports exist for exactly this reason, and so does this.

What does NOT get a month sibling on the same argument: the per-unit Input/Output read widens oee.work_center_day_reports over the month, because summing counts WITHIN one unit is exact addition with no rate in it. §23.1 applies and there is nothing there for you to load. Note that reading the LINE DAY rows rather than the line MONTH rows is deliberate and gives FINER unit resolution: a line whose unit changed mid-month has a NULL unit on its month row, where its day rows give two honest buckets.

26.2 The one thing this table adds: business_date is the FIRST of the month
ck_amr_month_start CHECK (business_date = date_trunc('month', business_date)::date) — 0014's ck_wcmr_month_start, verbatim. §15.3's rule: not the last, and not midnight of the first.

It matters more than it looks. Every READ resolves its window from the row's own business_date and resolveReportWindow truncates to the month, so a mid-month value would still produce the right window — but the LIST orders and filters on the column directly, and month is a nullable display label OUT of the key that nothing joins on. A row dated the 15th would sort between two other months' rows and answer a year = 2026 filter from a position no reader could predict.

26.3 The roll-up, which is §15.5's with 0024's two twists
durations and counts   ->  SUM   (over the area's LINES *and* the month's DAYS)
rates + mttr/mtbf      ->  RECOMPUTE from those sums
Never avg(availability) and never an average of the days' rates.

The durations are LINE-milliseconds times a month. A five-line area's availability_time over a 30-day month is ~3,600 hours, not ~720 and not ~744. The Run Time tile carries a tooltip saying so, and its sentence is deliberately different from the day screen's because the magnitude is ~30x larger. Do not divide by the line count or by the day count.
The month length is not a constant, and nothing in this app computes one. Across a DST transition a calendar month is 743 or 745 real hours. The pipeline sums what elapsed; the API's boundary arithmetic is resolveReportWindow's, in Postgres, with AT TIME ZONE resolving each boundary's own offset.
mttr / mtbf are RATIOS. Neither table stores a failure count, so recover it per source row as updt_time / mttr and rebuild the two ratios over the summed repair time and the summed failure count. §15.4's rule that they are NULL rather than 0 is unchanged.
apps/api/scripts/seed/0023_area_month_reports_dev.sql is the executable form of this section, and like 0022 it is normative rather than a stand-in — the day→month hop is normative on every subject in this schema (0013's seed and 0015's step 3 both say so). Its step 2 asserts the duration sums, that the rates were recomputed rather than averaged, that every row is dated the first of its month, and that the counts are paired with their unit in both directions.

One thing that seed does that 0022 cannot: it carries a mass through if one exists. It sums the day rows' counts rather than writing NULL, and gates the unit on the days AGREEING — count(DISTINCT weight_uom_id) = 1 AND count(weight_uom_id) = count(*). The second half is §16.3(c)'s NULL-skipping trap: count(DISTINCT x) skips NULLs, so a month mixing one unit-less day with twenty-nine KG ones would otherwise report a confident KG over a sum that silently dropped the unit-less day.

26.4 The watermark
area_month_reports is now in ck_etl_watermarks_table. Please write the row, and write last_business_date as the latest MONTH START rather than a month end — that is what this table's business_date holds, and the browser compares the two as business days. A month-end value would make the current month read as loaded before its last day had run.

26.5 What is deliberately NOT asked of you
No shift table, and there will not be one. The requirement is explicit — "only have 2 type of report on the Area" — so the application's AreaGrain is a two-member union rather than a reuse of the {shift, day, month} triple. This is the first subject in this schema where that triple has been broken deliberately rather than by absence.
No teep, no effective_out, no member count. §25.6's four absences, unchanged. The member count is still the field most likely to be asked for next.
Nothing new on any source table. Every sub-resource behind the month screens is a read the day screens already make with a wider dateTo.
No year grain. §23.2 says factory is the only subject that needs one, and nothing in this schema or in the application's grain plumbing admits one yet (TODOS.md §74).
26.6 Questions
Q1. Is a month with one day of production a row? We would rather have it — a missing row reads as "did not run", which is §14's argument. Say if you plan a floor.
Q2. Should the month row be REBUILT each run, or upserted as the month progresses? The unique key (area_id, business_date) supports either, and the screen is honest under both — but a partially-elapsed month whose OEE is computed over the elapsed part only is a figure a supervisor will compare against a full month. If you write it progressively, we would like last_business_date on the watermark to say how far it covers, which it already does.
Q3. Does the mass conversion happen per DAY and then sum, or over the month's counts directly? They differ if a product's std_weight changed mid-month. Either is defensible; we would like to know which, because the day and month screens will then disagree by that amount and the difference should be explainable rather than discovered.
27. What 0027 adds — the YEAR grain, and a widening of §23.2 we are stating rather than slipping in
Three tables — oee.work_unit_year_reports, oee.work_center_year_reports and oee.area_year_reports. One subject, one year. They back the OEE Performance dashboard's three YEARLY screens and they all ship EMPTY.

27.1 WE ARE ASKING FOR MORE THAN §23.2 SAID, AND THIS IS THE ASK
§23.2's table puts a year grain under factory only, and §26.5 says "No year grain" in as many words. That was right when it was written. The application has since been asked for a yearly OEE Performance dashboard at work unit, work center and area — the same second surface §23.2 names for those subjects, one grain coarser — and three tables is what that costs.

We are flagging it rather than letting you discover three unasked-for tables in a migration. If you would rather the application derived a year in the reader, say so and we will — but §27.2 is why we think you should not want that.

Factory is still absent at every grain. It has no report table, and oee.downtime_reports has no factory_id, so it remains the one unmapped SCOPE_COLUMN member.

27.2 Why a table, when a reader could widen the month range — §15.5, a third time
durations and counts   ->  SUM        widening a month range gives this
rates (oee, a, p, q)   ->  RECOMPUTE  widening a month range does NOT
A year's OEE is not the average of its months' OEEs. This is §26.1's argument one grain up and nothing about it is new: the moment the API recomputes a year's rates for itself there are two definitions of OEE in the system, one in dbt and one in the reader, on screens that drill into each other. That is the failure 0023, 0024 and 0025 each exist to prevent.

What still gets no year sibling on the same argument: anything that sums COUNTS. Exact addition with no rate in it needs no table (§23.1), which is why 0016's product-count pair serves a month by widening and always will.

27.3 Each table is its month sibling's measure set, column for column
mirrors
oee.work_unit_year_reports	work_unit_month_reports
oee.work_center_year_reports	work_center_month_reports
oee.area_year_reports	area_month_reports
Deliberately, and it is what lets ONE payload type, ONE projection and ONE card set serve both grains per subject — the property 0025 preserved between the two area tables. Every rule those three carry is carried here unchanged: a line has two units and total_out = good_out + reject + rework is FALSE at that grain (§16.4a); an area has one unit and it is a MASS, its durations are LINE-milliseconds, and it has no teep because TEEP divides by a calendar an area does not own (§25).

Three departures, each of which will look like an oversight:

business_date is JANUARY 1, enforced by ck_{wuyr,wcyr,ayr}_year_start. §15.3's rule one grain up: not December 31, and not midnight of January 1. It matters for ck_amr_month_start's reason — the LIST orders and filters on this column directly.
No date timestamptz on the machine table, unlike its month sibling. 0014 dropped that column deliberately for the line grain and 0024/0025 never had one; a new table has no upstream history to preserve.
No display-label column. The three month tables carry a nullable month varchar(50) out of the key that nothing reads, because the format was never specified upstream (§15.7). A year label would be a redundant, derivable column on a table with no such legacy — §23.1 at column scale. business_date IS the year.
27.4 The roll-up, which is §15.5's with each subject's own twists
durations and counts   ->  SUM       (over the year's MONTHS)
rates + mttr/mtbf      ->  RECOMPUTE from those sums
Never avg(availability) and never an average of the months' rates.

A YEAR'S LENGTH IS NOT A CONSTANT, twice over. 8,760 hours, or 8,784 in a leap year — and 8,759 or 8,761 where a DST transition falls inside it. So + 365 days is wrong roughly one year in four AND at every transition. Nothing in this application computes a year length: the pipeline sums what elapsed, and resolveReportWindow does the boundary arithmetic in Postgres with AT TIME ZONE so each boundary resolves its own offset. Our integration suite asserts a year equals the sum of its twelve month windows, in a DST zone.
The area's durations are LINE-milliseconds times a YEAR. A five-line area's availability_time reads ~43,800 hours. That is the intended figure. Do not divide by the line count or by the month count.
mttr / mtbf are RATIOS. Neither table stores a failure count, so recover it per source row as updt_time / mttr and rebuild both ratios over the summed repair time and the summed failure count. §15.4's rule that they are NULL rather than 0 is unchanged.
apps/api/scripts/seed/002{5,6,7}_*_year_reports_dev.sql are the executable form of this section, one per subject, and they are normative rather than stand-ins — the day→month hop is normative on every subject in this schema (0013's seed, 0015's step 3, 0023's seed all say so), and month→year is that hop one step further with no new argument. Each seed's step 2 asserts the duration sums, that the rates were recomputed rather than averaged, that every row is dated January 1, and that the counts are paired with their unit in both directions — per SIDE on the line.

27.5 The watermarks
work_unit_year_reports, work_center_year_reports and area_year_reports are now in ck_etl_watermarks_table. Please write all three rows, and write last_business_date as the latest YEAR START rather than a year end — that is what these tables' business_date holds, and the browser compares the two as business days. A year-end value would make the current year read as loaded before its last month had run.

One thing the dashboard depends on that is easy to miss: the year TREND reads the MONTH table, so it reports the MONTH watermark, not the year one. A plant whose month model stopped in June would otherwise draw six points and claim to be current.

27.6 What is deliberately NOT asked of you
No year grain for SKU, and none for factory. oee.product_report_wc_day has no month sibling either; factory has no table at all.
No approval at year grain, on any subject — and the LINE one is the sharpest. A line's approve is already a cascade over its machines' shift reports; at year grain it would close roughly 1,095 shifts times N machines, which is not the permission APPROVE_LINE_ROLE grants. The application registers four routes per subject at this grain (list, detail, OEE trend, rejects) and nothing else.
No quality entry. An entry is keyed by LINE and business DAY.
Nothing new on any source table. Every sub-resource behind the year screens is a read the month screens already make with a wider dateTo.
27.7 Questions
Q1. Is a year with one month of production a row? We would rather have it — a missing row reads as "did not run", which is §14's argument.
Q2. Rebuilt each run, or upserted as the year progresses? The unique keys support either and the screens are honest under both, but a partially-elapsed year whose OEE is computed over the elapsed part only is a figure a supervisor will compare against a full one. If you write progressively, we would like last_business_date to say how far it covers — which it already does.
Q3. Does the area's mass conversion happen per MONTH and then sum, or over the year's counts directly? They differ if a product's std_weight changed mid-year. §26.6's Q3 one grain up, and we would like the same answer to cover both.
28. What 0028 adds — ONE ONTOLOGY on every table, and a rename we need you to know about
0028 puts the full mes-master-data hierarchy — enterprise → site → area → work center → work unit — on every Gold report table and on every fact table a report screen reads. Twenty-three tables. It also renames factory_id / factory_name to site_id / site_name on the five tables that had them.

Nothing in it is a new table and nothing in it changes a measure. What it changes is how much of the hierarchy a row states about itself, and one column name.

28.1 THE RENAME, AND WHY WE THINK IT HAD TO HAPPEN NOW
0006, 0018, 0024, 0025 and 0027 each added factory_id / factory_name meaning "the level above the area". There is no factory in mes-master-data. Its hierarchy is ms_core.enterprices → ms_core.sites → ms_core.areas → ms_core.work_centers → ms_core.work_units; the level above an area is a SITE, and above that an ENTERPRISE. factory was a local name for a level that already had one upstream.

§23.3 is why that is not cosmetic: Gold is meant to be read by people outside this application, and "column names and semantics are a public interface". A column named for a level the master data does not have is a column an outside analyst cannot join on. So this is a rename rather than a second column beside the first — two names for one level is how a stranger groups by both and halves every figure.

It is safe for exactly one reason and the reason expires. Every factory_* column is NULL on every row today: nothing upstream resolves the level above an area (0024's own comment says "NOT filled, anywhere") and no dbt model writes either column. That is the same licence 0013 used to correct availablity_loss_time and the one §23.4 offered for downtime_reports.date — and it will not be available once you start writing them.

If any model of yours already selects factory_id or factory_name, it needs the new name. We believe none does. Please tell us if we are wrong, and we will ship a compatibility view rather than ask you to change a running model.

28.2 THE COLUMNS, BY WHAT EACH TABLE WAS MISSING
Every table now carries the full chain ABOVE its own grain. Nothing carries a level at or below it.

tables	what they had	what 0028 adds
work_unit_{shift,day,month,year}_reports	work unit, work center	area, site, enterprise
work_center_{shift,day,month,year}_reports	work center, area	site, enterprise
product_report_wc_day	work center, area	site, enterprise
area_{day,month,year}_reports	area, factory	site (renamed), enterprise
downtime_reports, downtime_log_events	work unit, work center, area	site, enterprise
product_count_wu_{shift,day}	work unit	work center, area, site, enterprise
product_count_wc_{shift,day}	work center	area, site, enterprise
reject_count_wu_shift	work unit, work center	work center code, area, site, enterprise
reject_count_wc_shift	work center, area	site, enterprise
product_perf_w{u,c}_hour	… area, factory	site (renamed), enterprise
work_center_quality_entries	work center, work unit	area, site, enterprise
Every one is NULLABLE, every one is integer + varchar(255), and none is in any key or any constraint. The names in bold are the ones a screen reads today.

What 0028 deliberately does NOT touch: work_unit_shift_report_approvals, …_approval_events, downtime_report_history, write_audit and etl_watermarks. Those are append-only audit trails addressed by natural key and never scanned by area — a denormalised label there would be a second place for the hierarchy to drift with no read that would notice.

28.3 WHAT WE ARE ASKING YOU TO FILL, AND IN WHAT ORDER
area_id and area_name first, on the four work_unit_* report tables. They are the ones a screen reads and the ones no table carried. Everything else on the list is genuinely lower priority.

The reason is §28.4. The rest — site_*, enterprise_*, and area_* on the count/reject/hourly tables — is a denormalisation we want for the reason 0024 gave for its own: so an external analyst can group without joining out to master data, and so a future factory report is a read rather than a hierarchy lookup. Nothing in the application reads them yet.

You already resolve area_id for oee.product_perf_wu_hour (0006) and for the work_center_* tables, so the lookup exists; this asks for it on more rows rather than for anything new.

28.4 THE CONSEQUENCE WE NEED TO BE EXPLICIT ABOUT: A NULL area_id IS NOW INVISIBLE
Every report list in the application is scoped to one area. The web app has a header area picker; it used to decide only which LINES a page could offer, and it is now a predicate on every list request — machine, line, SKU and area.

So the meaning of a NULL area_id changed without the column changing:

before 0028   a row missing a label two screens happened to read
after  0028   a row that appears on NO screen in the application
It is not merely excluded from that area's totals. It is excluded from every area, so it is unreachable — and the screen shows an ordinary empty state, which reads as "this area was idle", not as "the label has not landed".

We are NOT asking for an unattributed count beside it, and the contrast with §21 is deliberate. product_id is OCCUPANCY OVER TIME: nothing can derive which SKU was running during a stop, so a residual has to travel with every per-SKU payload. area_id is CONTAINMENT: the area IS derivable from work_unit_id, permanently, so a NULL is a missing LABEL and the fix is a backfill. Shipping a residual would invite a reader to treat denormalisation lag as an attribution problem, and would make it easier to leave un-backfilled.

Q1 — is area_id sparse in production today? If the answer is "it will stay sparse", tell us: that turns this into §21's shape after all, and we will ship the residual count and say so on the empty states. We would rather do that than have supervisors read "no reports" as an answer.

28.5 oee.work_center_quality_entries IS THE ONE TABLE HERE YOU MUST NOT WRITE
It gains the same six columns and they are ours to fill, not yours. §18's rule is unchanged: that table is written by the operator and only READ by you. A NULL area_id there after our own backfill is our bug, not pipeline lag.

It is in this migration because TODOS §79 asked for exactly that column — the area activity feed currently fans out one query per line for want of it — and §25.5 lists it as optional. It is no longer optional; it is just not yours.

One correction, so you are not told something that is not true yet. Our write path does not fill these columns today, and 0017's append-only trigger means a backfill is impossible — it compares the whole row minus the four void columns, so there is no subset an UPDATE could touch. Entries recorded before we fix that keep a NULL area_id permanently. Nothing about this asks anything of you; it is recorded here only because §28.3's table lists the table and you would otherwise reasonably assume the column arrives populated.

28.6 What we would like back
Q1 above — is area_id sparse, and will it stay sparse?
Confirmation that no model selects factory_id / factory_name, so the rename in §28.1 costs you nothing.
A rough order for §28.3, if ours is wrong — in particular whether site_* and enterprise_* are cheap to resolve alongside area_id or a separate lookup.
Open risks
An approval can orphan, silently, and nothing detects it. Approval state is keyed on (work_unit_id, date, shift) rather than on work_unit_shift_reports.id, which is what makes it survive a pipeline restatement (§12). The residual case is the opposite one: if a report is ever re-keyed — a corrected shift calendar moving its (date, shift) — the approval no longer matches any row, the report reads open again, and there is no test, no error and no user-visible signal. There are no foreign keys anywhere in oee and there cannot be, so nothing can prevent it. A reconciliation query is in 0010's header and in §12; deliberately no cleanup job, because an orphaned row is evidence that somebody approved something.
The work_unit_* DAG has no repository. It is being developed on one laptop. Until it is pushed to molca-id there is no review path, no history, and nobody else can redeploy it. This document is meanwhile the only durable spec of what Gold expects.
oee.reject_count_wu_shift is empty, and the Quality Loss tab is shipped against it. The screen degrades honestly — it reports "not loaded yet" rather than a clean shift — but it shows a supervisor nothing until the model in §3.8 exists. This is the same trade 0007 made for the downtime detail columns, taken once more.
Nobody knows how far the ranked rejects and the reject tile will diverge. The screen's footnote tells the reader they will not match, which is true by construction, but the magnitude is unmeasured. Test 2 in §3.8 exists to find out.
oee.downtime_log_events is empty, and the Others tab is shipped against it. The screen degrades honestly — it reports "not loaded yet" rather than a shift nothing stopped — but it shows a supervisor nothing until the model in §3.9 exists. The same trade 0007 and 0008 made, taken a third time.
Two tabs on one page now count the same stops from two tables, and the divergence is unmeasured. That is by design — one source is immutable, the other is operator-editable — but nobody knows the magnitude. Test 2 in §3.9 exists to find out, and it needs source_event_id (§3.3.2) to say anything better than a per-shift count comparison.
The event log carries no instant, so a shift assignment is auditable only through Silver. If the shift calendar is ever corrected retroactively, those rows cannot be re-cut from this table alone; they must be reloaded from Silver by event_id. A nullable occurred_at timestamptz was deliberately left out of 0009 on §3.3's ground, and is cheap to add while the table is empty.
0009's constraints have not been exercised. The DDL is applied on dev and the read path is verified in a browser, but nothing has yet tried to INSERT a row it should reject — ck_dtle_reasons' function-backed predicate, ck_dtle_reasons_1d, ON CONFLICT (event_id) and the audit triggers are all still unproven in the direction that matters. §11 lists what the first run on a throwaway has to confirm.
§2.1: downtime_reports cannot be upserted idempotently. This used to name two tables; 0006 closed the other half by dropping work_unit_perf_analytics in favour of product_perf_wu_hour, which has a natural key. As of 2026-08-25 this also gates a shipped feature: a stop without source_event_id cannot be edited at all, which is every stop the pipeline has loaded.
0011's shape constraints can abort a pipeline load. A blank or non-string label in reason or actions is now a failed statement rather than a mis-grouped Pareto bar (§14). That is the trade §3.9 already made for downtime_log_events.reasons and §3.3 asks for on this table, and it is deliberate — but it moves a rendering defect into the load path, and the DAG has no repository in which to review the model that would hit it (§18). The live table was surveyed clean before the constraint was added; a database whose contents differ has not been.
An operator's downtime edit is one un-joined model away from being silently discarded. §13 asks the pipeline to apply the override when it rebuilds downtime_reports; nothing in the database can enforce it, because no constraint can express "this column should hold what a different table's latest row says". The failure is a chart that quietly reverts to the machine's original values, with the operator's correction still sitting in the trail. The singular dbt test in §13 is the only mechanical guard, and it lives in a repository nobody in this repo can see (§18). This is the highest-consequence unenforced instruction in this document.
The freeze has a stated hole for long-open stops. Editing a stop is refused if any shift report it overlaps has been approved — but an unfinished stop (end_at IS NULL) is treated as reaching only MAX_OPEN_DOWNTIME_DAYS forward, not forever, because the literal reading would make such a stop permanently uneditable. So an approval further out than that will not freeze it, and such an edit can still move a signed-off report's numbers. Deliberate, bounded, and recorded in TODOS.md rather than left to be discovered.
Nothing asks the pipeline to recompute one report after an edit. Changing a stop's category moves time between schedule loss and availability loss, so the aggregates in work_unit_shift_reports are stale until the next scheduled run. The browser says so and does not pretend otherwise. A trigger is sketched in downtime-edit-trd.md, not built and not agreed.
The 0006 drop was not verifiable from here. Because the DAG has no repository, nobody in this repo could grep for a work_unit_perf_analytics model. If one exists on your laptop, its next run breaks. This needed a yes/no from you before the migration was deployed — see §9.
oee.work_unit_day_reports and oee.work_unit_month_reports are empty, and the By Day / By Monthly screens are shipped against them. The same trade 0007, 0008 and 0009 each made, taken a fourth time. Both screens degrade honestly, but a supervisor sees nothing until the models in §15 exist. Neither table has a watermark row either, so loadedThrough is null and the screens cannot yet distinguish "no downtime" from "not loaded" the way the shift screen can.
The three work_center_* tables are empty, and the Line report screens are shipped against them. The same trade 0007, 0008, 0009 and 0013 each made, taken a fifth time. The screens degrade honestly to an empty state, but a supervisor sees nothing until the models in §16 exist. They have no watermark rows either, so they cannot yet tell "this line did not run" from "not loaded".
A line row written from some of its machines is indistinguishable from a complete one, unless the pipeline writes both counts. §16.5 asks for work_unit_count and expected_work_unit_count; if the second is left NULL the screen falls back to a bare count and a partial line renders a plausible, slightly-lower OEE with nothing to flag it. The §16.8 test is the mechanical guard, and like §13's it lives in a repository nobody in this repo can see (§18).
The availablity_loss_time rename in 0013 is the one change that can break work already in progress. It was safe on the evidence available here — the tables are empty and no model in this repo's view writes them — but that evidence stops at the edge of a DAG nobody here can read (§18). If such a model exists, its next run fails with "column does not exist". Loud, not silent, and reversible today; see §15.1.
